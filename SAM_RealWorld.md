# ServiceNow SAM in a Hybrid Azure Environment: Discovery vs. Hidden License Data

## Introduction

Enterprise environments today often span **hybrid infrastructure** – for example, primary workloads in *Microsoft Azure* with some on-premises servers and endpoints. In such contexts, **ServiceNow Software Asset Management (SAM)** can provide a unified view of software assets across cloud and on-premise resources. This report explores how ServiceNow SAM *automatically discovers software license data* (especially via SCCM integration and ServiceNow’s Discovery probes) and what license information remains **hidden or manual**. We also highlight **real-world use cases** where SAM uncovered unknown software license usage, and we provide insights on the balance between **passive discovery vs. manual effort**. Real enterprise examples, lessons learned, and metrics are included to illustrate SAM’s impact in Azure-centric hybrid environments.

## Automated Discovery via SCCM and ServiceNow Probes

ServiceNow SAM leverages multiple data sources to **passively collect software inventory** across the enterprise. Key mechanisms include:

* **Microsoft SCCM (Configuration Manager) Integration:** ServiceNow’s SCCM integration can pull comprehensive lists of **installed software on Windows devices** into the CMDB. The latest SCCM connector isn’t limited to specific titles – it imports detailed software installation data per device, with scope only bounded by what the SCCM agents report. In practice, this means that *virtually all installed applications on managed Windows endpoints* are captured automatically via SCCM. The quality and depth of this data depend on SCCM’s client settings and package inventory configuration, but well-configured SCCM environments provide a rich feed of software names, versions, and installation counts without manual surveying.

* **ServiceNow Discovery Probes:** For infrastructure not covered by SCCM (e.g. Linux servers, cloud VMs, network devices), ServiceNow’s own *Discovery* can actively scan and identify software. Discovery uses patterns to detect installed software and services (for example, finding Oracle databases, middleware, or CAD applications on servers). **Software discovery models** are created during scans and normalized against ServiceNow’s content library. This agentless probing extends automated inventory beyond just Windows PCs, ensuring *cloud-hosted and on-prem servers* are also inventoried for software deployments. Notably, ServiceNow’s **Bring Your Own License (BYOL) discovery** can detect software running in cloud VMs: for instance, SAM can **automatically identify Windows Server or SQL Server instances in Azure/AWS** and apply the correct license metrics (accounting for hybrid use rights, edition flexibility, or unlimited virtualization entitlements). The SAM engine will reconcile these cloud deployments with on-prem license entitlements, so hybrid-use rights are properly applied. A new SAM feature even automates reclaiming unlicensed cloud instances if they’re detected.

* **Normalization and Enrichment:** A major value of ServiceNow SAM is that it *normalizes discovered data*. Raw discovery often finds cryptic software names or versions, but the **SAM Content Library** standardizes these into recognizable titles (e.g. “Adobe Acrobat Pro 2017”) for license tracking. According to ServiceNow, **SAM normalization eliminates** a lot of manual data clean-up when determining compliance. In other words, the platform automatically enriches discovery records with correct publisher names, versions, and categorization, which is critical for accurate license reconciliation. *(Without normalization, IT teams would have to manually reconcile many discovered entries to actual licensed products.)*

* **Automatic Usage Tracking:** In addition to static inventory, some usage data is passively collected. If SCCM’s software metering is enabled or if ServiceNow’s *Agent Client Collector* is used, **application usage metrics** (e.g. hours run in last 90 days) can feed into SAM. Similarly, ServiceNow provides **SaaS connectors** (or *“License Connections”*) to cloud services, which automatically pull subscription and usage information from platforms like Office 365, Adobe Creative Cloud, etc. For example, ServiceNow’s out-of-box integration with Microsoft 365 can ingest user subscription assignments and even login activity. This gives SAM a live view of SaaS license allocation and actual consumption without manual effort. In one case, ServiceNow’s internal IT captured Microsoft 365 subscription data *automatically from the Azure portal*, providing a “complete picture of allocation and compliance” for Office 365 licenses. This kind of automated feed ensures that *cloud-based license usage* (e.g. how many users are assigned an E5 license and how many are actually active) is discovered and tracked continuously.

**Table 1. Examples of SAM-Discovered Data vs. Manual Data Needs**

| **Software Asset Data**                | **Discovered Automatically?**     | **Details / Examples**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Installed software (name, version)** | Yes – via SCCM & Discovery        | SCCM integration imports all installed programs on PCs; ServiceNow Discovery finds software on servers and devices not in SCCM. Normalization then standardizes these records.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Cloud VM software (Azure/AWS)**      | Yes – with cloud discovery        | ServiceNow can discover software on Azure/AWS VMs and apply BYOL license rules automatically (e.g. identifying Windows Server on an Azure VM). Dual-use and other cloud licensing rights are accounted for in reconciliation.                                                                                                                                |
| **Software usage metrics (runtime)**   | Partially – if configured         | SCCM or ServiceNow can collect app usage (e.g. last used date, hours used) for installed software. This feeds SAM’s **Removal Candidates** for reclamation of unused software.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **SaaS subscriptions & activity**      | Partially – via connectors/API    | ServiceNow SAM connectors retrieve subscription lists and usage from SaaS platforms. *E.g.* it can sync all Office 365 user licenses and their last activity. Custom **SaaS License Connections** via Flow Designer allow integration to any SaaS with an API.                                                                                               |
| **License entitlements (purchases)**   | **No – manual input needed**      | Purchase records and contracts (entitlements) must be loaded or entered by SAM managers. SAM does not “discover” how many licenses you bought – this data comes from procurement systems or spreadsheets.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **License keys / certificates**        | No – not discovered by default    | *Installed* license keys (serial numbers) are generally **not collected by Discovery out-of-the-box**. For most vendors, keys are not exposed for automated collection. Organizations must manually record or import license keys if needed for tracking.                                                                                                    |
| **User-to-license assignments**        | Partially – if in source system   | For user-based licenses (e.g. named user or user subscriptions), SAM will reflect assignments that come from source integrations (like O365 admin portal data). But any manual allocations (like a standalone Adobe license assigned to a user) need to be recorded in SAM by an analyst if not discoverable.                                                |
| **Advanced license metrics**           | Partially – via specialized scans | Complex metrics (Oracle processor cores, IBM PVUs, etc.) require specific **patterns or integrations**. ServiceNow SAM offers modules (e.g. **Oracle GLAS integration**, **IBM ILMT integration**) to import these usage metrics. Without those, data like Oracle option usage or IBM sub-capacity usage remains hidden until pulled in via the proper tool. |

As Table 1 suggests, a **large portion of raw software inventory data is gathered automatically** by ServiceNow SAM’s integrations. *Every installation on managed machines, and every VM or device discovered, becomes a record in the SAM system.* This passive discovery typically covers the majority of software in use (often 80–90% of the estate by volume, according to implementation experts). However, **discovery alone doesn’t tell the full license story** – entitlements (what you *own*) and certain usage details still require human input or specialized queries. We examine those gaps next.

## Hidden Data and Manual Effort in License Tracking

While ServiceNow SAM automates inventory collection, **some license data remains hidden without manual effort or targeted querying**. Key examples include:

* **Purchased License Entitlements:** SAM can’t magically know how many licenses your company purchased for a given product – those come from contracts and procurement records. In real deployments, teams must **load all historical license purchases and contracts** into the SAM module. This often means gathering records from procurement systems or reseller reports and importing them as *Software Entitlements* in ServiceNow. Missing entitlements are a common gap; one SAM implementation guide notes that if SAM isn’t showing compliance risks or savings, it’s likely because *entitlement data is incomplete*. In short, **license ownership data requires manual input**, and significant upfront effort is spent collating this information.

* **License Metrics and Terms:** Many enterprise software products have complex license models (CPU-core licensing, enterprise agreements with upgrade/downgrade rights, cloud-use rights, etc.). ServiceNow SAM provides **Publisher Packs** for vendors like Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, SAP, etc., which encode common metrics – but administrators must configure them correctly. For example, you might need to set the core factor for Oracle processor licenses or the virtualization parameters for Windows Server Datacenter licenses. These settings are not “discovered”; they are manually configured in SAM so that reconciliation calculations reflect reality. Similarly, any special terms (like a license that allows unlimited test instances, or country-specific entitlements) must be entered by SAM admins. Enterprises report that time invested in **defining license metrics and rights** in the SAM tool is crucial to avoid false compliance gaps.

* **Unused or Underutilized Software (Identification):** Paradoxically, *not* using software can make it “hidden” unless you specifically look for it. ServiceNow SAM addresses this by aggregating usage data to flag installations that haven’t been used recently. However, if usage collection isn’t in place, **identifying unused installations may require custom queries** (for example, querying SCCM’s metering data or running scripts on servers). Once usage data is available, SAM’s dashboards automatically highlight candidates for reclamation (e.g. installed but unused for 60+ days). **Without proper usage data feeds, unused licenses remain a blind spot** – the software might be discovered on a device, but you won’t know it’s a swap candidate versus a necessary installation.

* **SaaS and Shadow IT:** By default, SAM will track SaaS only if you configure connectors or manually input subscription info. Any *“Shadow IT”* – cloud software acquired outside official channels – can remain completely invisible to SAM’s discovery. For instance, if a team signs up for a SaaS tool without IT approval, it won’t be in SCCM or device inventory. Many enterprises find that *SaaS usage is widely underestimated*. Industry analysis shows on average companies use only \~45% of their provisioned SaaS licenses – meaning **55% of SaaS subscriptions are typically unused** and would be waste if not identified. Uncovering this waste requires actively pulling data from SaaS platforms or using a SaaS Management Platform. ServiceNow SAM Pro includes **SaaS License Management** for major apps, but anything not integrated remains hidden until IT becomes aware. Thus, ongoing efforts (like periodic surveys or expense audits) may be needed to catch rogue or under-reported SaaS usage. *One SAM consultant advises adopting a tiered oversight: focus on the big SaaS apps with connectors, but also periodically review spend reports to find smaller “long-tail” apps that slip under the radar.*

* **License Keys and Detailed Configurations:** As noted, ServiceNow Discovery does **not capture software license keys** by default. If you need an inventory of actual product keys or activation codes installed on machines (for instance, to find unauthorized use of a license key), you’d likely need a specialized script or third-party tool. A discussion on the ServiceNow community confirmed that *most publishers don’t expose license keys for automated discovery*, so any such data has to be populated via the entitlement records or manual entry. Similarly, certain configuration-dependent licenses (like features enabled on a device that incur license usage) may require targeted probes. For example, Oracle database Options and Management Packs are licensable features – ServiceNow can track them, but only if the Oracle discovery pattern is configured with credentials to query the DB for usage. If those are not set up, the **consumption of such features remains hidden** until an audit or a specific query is run.

In summary, **passive discovery excels at finding what software is installed and where**, but it doesn’t automatically know *whether you’re entitled to it, how much you’re using relative to entitlements, or whether you’re optimally licensed*. Those insights emerge only after feeding SAM the right supporting data (entitlements, usage metrics, contract rules) and sometimes running targeted checks. Next, we’ll see how enterprises have leveraged SAM in practice to uncover unknown usage and fill these gaps.

## Real-World Examples of Uncovered License Usage

Implementing ServiceNow SAM in a large, mixed environment often reveals surprising findings – from unnoticed installations to huge pools of underutilized licenses. Below are **concrete enterprise examples and anecdotes** highlighting unknown software license usage that SAM brought to light:

* **Excess Installations vs. Licenses (Compliance Gaps):** A common scenario is discovering more installations of a software than licenses owned – essentially an *unknown compliance risk*. In one forum example, an organization found **18 installations** of a particular software but had only **10 licenses purchased**, meaning *eight installs were unlicensed*. ServiceNow SAM’s reconciliation identified *11 installs* as unlicensed in that case (the count discrepancy hinted at additional historical or duplicate records), immediately flagging a compliance issue. This kind of insight is invaluable – previously, those extra installations were “off the books,” but SAM automatically surfaced them as *unlicensed installs* that needed remediation. The result is often a decision to purchase additional licenses or uninstall the software from certain machines to **eliminate compliance exposure**.

* **Unused Software Reclamation (Savings Opportunities):** Many enterprises have discovered significant *waste* in software usage through SAM’s data. For example, ServiceNow’s internal ITAM team used SAM to analyze usage of **Microsoft products** and other software, and they were able to identify a large number of licenses that were assigned but not being used. By implementing automated reclamation workflows, ServiceNow **reclaimed about \$1 million worth of software** over two years, simply by harvesting unused licenses and avoiding unnecessary renewals. One highlight was reclaiming unused Microsoft 365 and SharePoint licenses, which not only saved cost but also ensured compliance by freeing up or removing licenses that could have triggered over-deployment if left unchecked. This example shows how *passive discovery + active reclamation* uncovers “quiet” waste (licenses paid for but not utilized) that was previously unknown to the organization.

* **SaaS Subscription Audit – Case of the 4,500 Trials:** A particularly striking case occurred at ServiceNow itself during the shift to remote work. Needing a digital whiteboarding tool, the company provisioned **4,503 employees with trial access to Miro** (a SaaS app) during the early COVID-19 period. As the paid renewal approached, IT used a **SaaS license connection** in ServiceNow SAM to pull actual usage data from Miro’s API. The findings were eye-opening: out of 4,503 provisioned users, *only 1,182 were actively using Miro*. Over 3,300 accounts were essentially idle – a huge surplus. Armed with this data, the team right-sized the subscription renewal to cover just the active users and immediately saved an estimated **\$740,000** in avoided license costs. This unknown usage (or rather, *unknown non-usage*) would have led to overspending if not for SAM. Moreover, the integration remains in place to **monitor license utilization daily and automatically reclaim unused SaaS licenses** going forward, preventing waste from creeping back. This anecdote underscores how SAM can illuminate cloud subscription usage patterns that would be impossible to see through manual tracking.

* **Identifying “Shadow” Installations:** Large environments often suffer from *software sprawl* – legacy applications or prohibited software quietly installed on some servers. An enterprise SAM deployment can uncover these hidden installations. For instance, one global **biopharma company** engaged in a SAM program found a number of **“unknown users and costs”** in their IT environment, which SAM helped to *reduce or eliminate*. In practice, this meant discovering users consuming software licenses that had not been accounted for or identifying departments running applications the central IT didn’t know about. By bringing these to light, the company avoided nearly **\$40 million in IT costs** over two years, by renegotiating licenses and cutting out redundancies. Similarly, SAM can detect unauthorized software (e.g., someone installing a copy of an expensive CAD tool outside the approved process), since it will show up in the discovery data and appear as an **“unentitled install”** on SAM reports. Organizations have used these insights to enforce policies – either reclaiming those installations or purchasing proper licenses – thus **mitigating audit risks** proactively.

* **Optimizing Mixed Vendor License Use:** In a hybrid Azure/on-prem environment with both Microsoft and non-Microsoft software, SAM provides a holistic view that can drive optimization across the board. A *global manufacturing firm* case study (via an Anglepoint SAM managed service) revealed savings with multiple vendors once SAM was in place. Over a managed period, they achieved **€6 million in cost savings/avoidance** by addressing various unknown usage issues. Notably, the breakdown included \~€550K saved by optimizing **Microsoft Visio and Project** deployments (indicating many users had these installed or assigned but weren’t using them, so licenses were downgraded or removed). Another €250K was saved by optimizing **Oracle Java** usage – likely by identifying machines that had Oracle’s JVM installed but didn’t actually need a licensed version (Oracle’s licensing of Java changed, and many companies discovered they had untracked Java installs). They also saved on **System Center (SCCM) licensing** costs (about €750K in avoidance), which suggests SAM data showed that fewer SCCM client licenses were needed than assumed (perhaps by identifying decommissioned or duplicate clients). These examples show how *SAM’s comprehensive discovery* allows enterprises to find opportunities in both their Microsoft estate (e.g. under-used Visio, Project, or even Windows Server instances in Azure) and third-party software (like Oracle or engineering software) to either re-harvest licenses or eliminate needless deployments. Such insights are often **impossible to achieve without a dedicated SAM tool** aggregating all the data.

* **Audit Defense – catching issues early:** Another real-world lesson is using SAM’s ongoing reconciliation to catch compliance issues *before* a vendor audit does. One organization integrating **ServiceNow SAM Pro with Oracle GLAS** (Oracle’s audit scripts) found several databases using extra features (like Oracle Partitioning and Advanced Security Option) that they were not licensed for. ServiceNow’s discovery (with the Oracle integration) flagged these as “unlicensed usage” in its reconciliation results, effectively alerting the IT team to either disable those features or procure the needed licenses **preemptively**. This kind of unknown usage – which would only surface in an audit otherwise – was *proactively uncovered* by SAM. Similarly, companies have used SCCM data via SAM to detect too many installations of Adobe or Autodesk software relative to entitlements and then true-up ahead of audits, avoiding penalties. The **SAM License Workbench** provides a single view of license positions (rights versus consumption) and can highlight overshoot in red. Users report that by having this up-to-date view, they’ve avoided surprise findings; as one SAM manager put it, *“SAM’s reconciliation engine automatically calculates complex licensing to identify overspending or audit risk”* – giving them a chance to respond before it costs the company.

These examples illustrate that **unknown software usage and entitlements become visible with SAM**. Whether it’s unused licenses that can be shed, or unseen installations that need attention, the tool surfaces actionable information. In hybrid environments, this can span everything from SaaS accounts to VMs in Azure to old on-prem servers. Not every discovery leads to cost savings – sometimes it reveals you need to spend more to be compliant – but in all cases it enables *informed decisions* rather than blind spots.

## Passive vs. Active Effort: Discovery vs. Manual Data Proportion

A frequent question in SAM programs is: *How much of our license data can we get “passively” (automatically), and how much do we have to chase manually?* In practice, **the majority of raw inventory data is discovered automatically**, but a significant minority of the *contextual data* (licenses owned, usage details) requires manual effort or verification. Some perspectives on this balance:

* **Inventory Coverage:** Enterprises deploying ServiceNow SAM often see **80%+ of their software installations automatically identified** via SCCM and Discovery within the first few scans. One case reported that switching from manual tracking to SCCM integration yielded a *detailed inventory of every software package per device* without filtering to only certain products. This means the passive discovery will likely cover nearly all commercially installed software across Windows, and with extended discovery, a good portion of Linux/Mac and cloud-hosted software as well. There will remain perhaps \~10-15% of software that isn’t immediately identified or normalized (e.g. homegrown applications or very niche titles might come through as “unrecognized”). Those require some manual normalization or the creation of custom discovery patterns. ServiceNow mitigates this by weekly content library updates and even machine learning for normalization, which *“improves your recognition rates in real time”* so that manual work is minimized. Still, organizations should expect an initial cleanup phase – perhaps **10–20% of discovered records** need manual classification or normalization early on; after that, the process is largely automated going forward.

* **Entitlement and Compliance Data:** *Nearly 0%* of entitlement information comes from passive discovery – it is almost entirely a manual or **data loading effort**. This is a one-time (and ongoing) task that can be labor-intensive: gathering contracts, parsing purchase records, and inputting license counts, types, and terms into SAM. For a large enterprise, loading entitlements for all major software publishers can take weeks of work, but it’s a critical foundation. The **proportion of license data requiring manual entry** is high in this category (100% of purchase counts, license types, etc.), but the good news is once it’s in, the ongoing maintenance is lighter (you only add new purchases or adjust for renewals). In short, **discovery gives you the “deployed” side of the equation, but the “entitled” side is manual** – you need both for SAM to calculate compliance.

* **Usage and Optimization Insights:** The effort here is mixed. Basic usage data (last used timestamps, metering) can be automated via integration, but often there’s *manual analysis or policy work* to act on it. For example, SAM might list 500 installations of Software X with no usage in 90 days; deciding to reclaim those licenses involves stakeholder communication, setting up reclamation rules, etc. Passive data collection provides the opportunity (e.g. “these installs are candidates”), while active SAM management involves creating **reclamation workflows** and engaging users. ServiceNow SAM Professional includes out-of-the-box reclamation rules that can automate much of this (e.g. uninstall software after approval if unused for N days), shifting what used to be a manual hunt into an automated process. One FedForum presentation noted that *“SAM identifies unused software and calculates potential savings to help asset managers decide when to reclaim a license,”* and the reclamation workflow **automates** the removals and provides an audit trail. So, while the initial setup is manual (you define what “unused” means, who approves removals, etc.), the ongoing identification of unused licenses becomes largely passive through continuous data collection.

* **Overall Effort vs. Payoff:** Anecdotally, enterprises find that **keeping SAM data current is perhaps 70% automated / 30% manual** effort over the long term. The passive discovery (70%) continuously feeds data (new installs, moves/adds/changes in the environment), and a dedicated SAM team (30% effort) focuses on the parts automation can’t do: liaising with procurement for new licenses, refining normalization for odd software, analyzing reports, and handling vendor true-ups. As SAM matures, that manual slice can shrink (some organizations integrate SAM so deeply with procurement and ITSM processes that new licenses and deployments are reflected in near-real-time). But even in the best case, **human oversight and periodic data validation are required** – for example, verifying that all relevant data sources are connected, or that a spike in usage is real and not a data error. One SAM manager advises focusing that human effort where it counts: *“You may not need \[full detail] for every \$5K desktop app, but you do for the big ones like Microsoft and Adobe… clearly articulate what data you need to be successful”*. This speaks to prioritizing manual efforts on high-value licenses and letting automated discovery handle broad coverage of everything else.

In the context of a hybrid Azure environment, the proportionate effort also depends on how cloud-native the organization is: Azure VMs and services can be auto-discovered to a large extent (inventory and even some license usage data), but things like **Azure Marketplace SaaS subscriptions or cloud PaaS services** may need manual tracking of their license implications. It’s wise to integrate Azure billing/usage data (via Cloud Insights or similar) to capture things like SQL Azure or other platform services that might carry license entitlements. That said, **the heavy lifting of day-to-day data collection is largely automated by ServiceNow**, freeing SAM analysts to spend their time on analysis and improvement rather than chasing data.

## Lessons Learned from Enterprise SAM Deployments

From the above use cases and data, several **key insights and best practices** emerge for enterprise-scale SAM in a hybrid Azure/on-prem context:

* **“Good Data is a Prerequisite” – Invest in Data Quality:** A recurring lesson is the importance of data accuracy. ServiceNow’s own SAM team stated, *“Good data is a prerequisite for good software asset management.”* Enterprises that succeeded with SAM began by auditing and cleansing their CMDB and entitlement records. For example, one implementation reduced compliance gaps by \~30% simply by reconciling and cleaning the CMDB data before turning on SAM. **Lesson:** Take time to integrate **multiple discovery sources** (SCCM, ServiceNow Discovery, Jamf for Macs, cloud APIs) and standardize the information. Eliminate duplicates and fill in hardware info (like CPU counts) which SAM might need for license calculations. This upfront effort pays off by enabling accurate, automated compliance reports.

* **Integrate SAM into IT Processes:** Don’t run SAM in a silo. Organizations realized major gains when they **embedded SAM into procurement and ITSM workflows**. For instance, ensuring *all software requests go through a ServiceNow catalog* linked to SAM helps prevent untracked software from being deployed. Similarly, setting up **automated reclamation** when employees leave or change roles (via HR onboarding/offboarding processes) closes the loop so that licenses are freed up immediately. One company linked SAM with change management to flag any change that could impact licensing (like installing a new SQL Server instance triggers a license check). **Lesson:** Use ServiceNow’s platform capabilities – tie SAM with Hardware Asset Management, contract management, and the service catalog. This ensures ongoing data completeness (e.g. every new purchase recorded in SAM, every retired server’s software marked accordingly) and catches “unknowns” before they happen (e.g. no server gets built without being discovered and licensed).

* **Focus on High-Risk/High-Value Software First:** In a hybrid environment, it’s often neither feasible nor necessary to perfectly track *every single application* from day one. Experienced SAM practitioners suggest prioritizing the big vendors and costly software for full license tracking. For example, **Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, IBM** – these typically represent the largest spend or audit risk. Make sure SAM is fully configured for these (all entitlements loaded, all servers discovered, license metrics verified). Meanwhile, lower-cost software can be managed at a lighter touch initially (perhaps discovered and visible in SAM, but you might not input every tiny license entitlement until needed). **Lesson:** This approach yields faster ROI – the unknown usage or inefficiencies in big license areas can mean millions in savings or avoided costs, as seen in the examples (e.g. Microsoft 365 and Visio/Project optimizations saved hundreds of thousands, Oracle/Java optimizations saved six figures). Tackling those first provides quick wins and business buy-in, which can later fund expanding SAM to the long tail of apps.

* **Leverage SAM Analytics for Continual Improvement:** Once data is flowing, the insights shouldn’t be one-time. Enterprises that achieved sustained value set up **regular SAM reviews and dashboards** for stakeholders. For example, building a Software Asset dashboard for each business unit showing their license compliance and utilization drives accountability. One organization established that *“All data is tracked and reviewed from the Microsoft dashboard for a complete view of compliance”* – meaning their SAM team publishes a live Office 365 compliance view to management. ServiceNow’s **Software Asset Workspace** provides interactive views to slice data by publisher, product, cost, etc., which companies use in quarterly business reviews or budgeting. **Lesson:** Make SAM findings visible and actionable – e.g., show application owners the list of unused licenses in their area along with potential savings if reclaimed. Many firms tie these savings to KPIs. In fact, ServiceNow includes a **“Estimated Cost Savings” metric** on the SAM Success dashboard to quantify how much money SAM has saved via reclamations and optimizations. Tracking this over time helps keep the program funded and focused.

* **Address SaaS Proactively – Don’t Ignore the Cloud:** With Azure and cloud being a big part of the environment, software asset management must extend to SaaS and cloud resources. Traditional SAM tools were focused on on-prem installs, but now *cloud subscription management is essential*. The **unknown 55% SaaS waste statistic** is a warning: if you don’t actively manage SaaS, you will overspend. Forward-looking enterprises incorporate **SaaS Management alongside SAM**. Whether via ServiceNow’s own SaaS License Management or a dedicated SaaS Management Platform, the lesson is to get visibility into cloud software usage. The example of Miro at ServiceNow demonstrates that a quick SaaS audit can save enormous costs. Similarly, organizations have started managing Office 365, Salesforce, and other major subscriptions with the same rigor as on-prem licenses – tracking active vs. assigned licenses, and running renewals through SAM processes. **Lesson:** Treat SaaS licenses as first-class citizens in asset management. Use automated connectors where possible, and implement governance so that new SaaS purchases are logged. This closes what used to be a major blind spot for SAM programs.

* **Results Can Be Substantial:** Finally, the real-world outcomes serve as encouragement. When SAM is properly implemented in a hybrid environment, companies have reported **double-digit percentage reductions in software spend**. For instance, *zeb*, a consulting firm, shared that their client achieved a **63% reduction in software licensing costs** after a comprehensive ServiceNow SAM implementation (streamlining processes and eliminating waste). While results vary, it’s common to see millions of dollars in savings/avoidance within the first year or two, as redundant licenses are shed and compliance issues are optimized. Moreover, SAM improves audit readiness – an oft-cited but less quantifiable benefit is the avoidance of audit fines or legal costs. The Global biopharma example indicated a *\$40M IT cost savings* partly by avoiding audits and aligning usage with entitlements. **Lesson:** Make use of those savings to continually justify the SAM effort and invest in areas that still have “unknowns.” Many organizations re-invest a portion of SAM savings into better tooling (e.g. adding the next set of publisher packs or advanced integrations) to drive even more value.

In conclusion, **ServiceNow SAM in an Azure-heavy, hybrid environment can automatically illuminate a large part of the software landscape**, from on-prem servers to cloud VMs and user subscriptions. It will discover most installed software and usage data passively, but it thrives with proper feeding of entitlement and context data. The balance of effort tends to shift from tedious data gathering (which becomes automated) to higher-level analysis and decision-making by IT asset managers. Crucially, real enterprises have used SAM to reveal **unknown license usage and inefficiencies** – and the payoff is measured in substantial cost savings, risk reduction, and improved operational insight. By combining automated discovery with strategic manual oversight, organizations can achieve a **holistic view of their software assets** and ensure no license (or dollar spent) is truly hiding in the shadows.
