Research and understanding availability of "deep research" agentic platforms or tools which can semantically search internal Fedramp data as well as public/private API accessible or browser accessible data to form a comprehensive understanding and solve business problems. 

Requirements:
1. Deep research spanning internal and external data
2. Cab be hosted in a private cloud (Fedramp) environment 
3. No data is retained or utilized for future model training

The platform or tool performing deep research must be hosted in or run within a private cloud, such as a Fedramp AWS VPC, and can search/crawl internal an external data. 

The platform or tool should be able to interact with command line, bash prompt, browser, operating system.  We are looking for a fully agentic approach to deep research. 

We must avoid any models which can share or train on our data. 

All security considerations should be well understood, we are not at this time evaluating specific security standards. 

Our preference is commercial off the shelf but we will consider open source solutions

Understood! I will research agentic deep research platforms that can operate within a private cloud (FedRAMP-compatible environments), conduct semantic searches across internal and external data sources, and utilize human-like interactions with SaaS applications via browsers. I will prioritize commercial off-the-shelf solutions but also consider open-source alternatives that meet your requirements, particularly those that ensure strict data isolation and do not train on user data. I'll let you know as soon as I have comprehensive insights.

# Agentic Deep Research Platforms for Secure Private Cloud Deployment

Several advanced AI platforms can serve as *agentic deep research assistants*, orchestrating complex search and automation tasks across data sources and applications. Below we outline commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions—and a notable open-source framework—that meet the requirements of deep research capabilities, private cloud deployment (e.g. AWS GovCloud/FedRAMP), strict data isolation, SaaS/browser interactions, and optional OS-level actions. We highlight their capabilities, security measures, and compliance credentials.

## Moveworks AI Platform (FedRAMP-Ready)

**Moveworks** offers an *agentic AI platform* that automates enterprise workflows using large language models, with an emphasis on security and compliance. It recently achieved **FedRAMP Ready** status, demonstrating its commitment to U.S. government security standards ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20we%20take%20immense,FedRAMP%20process%20and%20its%20requirements)). Moveworks provides a dedicated **GovCloud** environment hosted in AWS GovCloud (US) to ensure data segregation for public sector clients ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Working%20with%20Moveworks%20GovCloud)). Key capabilities include: 

- **Internal & External Research** – Moveworks’ AI Assistant can retrieve information from internal knowledge bases and systems. It integrates natively with enterprise applications (ServiceNow, Salesforce, Workday, etc.) to look up data, answer queries, and perform actions ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=5,end)). Through its **extensive plugin library**, it can also connect to APIs or tools for external information as needed, enabling rich research across sources ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=helping%20enable%20a%20quick%20return,on%20your%20investment)). 
- **Private Cloud Deployment** – The Moveworks **GovCloud** instance is a isolated cloud environment for government and other sensitive deployments, offering the same functionality as its commercial platform in a FedRAMP-aligned setting ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Working%20with%20Moveworks%20GovCloud)). This ensures agencies can use Moveworks entirely within a **FedRAMP Moderate** environment (authorization in progress) without data leaving the approved cloud. 
- **Data Security & Isolation** – Moveworks embeds strict security; customer data is safeguarded and used only to serve that customer. The platform does not train its foundation models on client-specific data, per compliance requirements (a necessity for FedRAMP). All interactions are encrypted and privacy measures are in place ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Working%20with%20Moveworks%20GovCloud)). 
- **Actionable Integrations** – The assistant can **take actions on SaaS platforms** via secure integrations. For example, it can create or update tickets, reset passwords, or query databases through provided connectors. These integrations “empower lookups, searches, and end-to-end automation” across systems ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=helping%20enable%20a%20quick%20return,on%20your%20investment)). While Moveworks primarily uses API integrations, it can emulate complex multi-step workflows to simulate human-like interactions. (For non-API systems, organizations could integrate Moveworks with RPA tools to drive web UIs if needed.) 
- **Optional OS-Level Actions** – Out-of-the-box, Moveworks focuses on cloud apps, but it enables developers to build custom **AI agents** for bespoke tasks ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=6,AI%20solutions%20to%20your%20needs)). Using this extensibility, organizations could script OS-level or command-line actions (for example, running a script on a server) if the environment permits. Its plugin framework provides a path to execute custom code securely.

**Compliance**: Moveworks’ security-first design and FedRAMP-ready designation indicate alignment with strict government standards ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20we%20take%20immense,FedRAMP%20process%20and%20its%20requirements)). Data remains isolated to each customer’s instance. Deployments in AWS GovCloud inherit FedRAMP High controls (e.g. encryption, access control) and Moveworks plans to pursue **FedRAMP Moderate authorization** for its GovCloud environment ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=regulatory%20and%20compliance%20needs%20of,US%20customers%20handling%20sensitive%20workloads)).

## Aisera AI Copilot and Service Experience Platform

**Aisera** provides an *AI Service Experience* platform (often described as an **AI Copilot**) that automates enterprise service and support through conversational AI and agents. It’s designed for secure enterprise use, offering **agentic AI** capabilities similar to Moveworks (Aisera is also recognized in ITSM AI solutions). Key features:

- **Internal Knowledge & External Data** – Aisera’s platform includes an **AI Search** module and **Agent Assist**, enabling it to semantically search internal repositories (knowledge bases, ticketing systems, documents) and provide answers or summaries. It can also incorporate **external data sources** as configured – administrators have control over which outside sources or internet data the AI may access ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Data%20Control%20%26%20User%20Consent)). This means Aisera can perform deep research combining internal data with web information (e.g. for customer support or research questions), while ensuring only approved sources are used. 
- **Agentic Workflow Automation** – Aisera supports dynamic multi-step flows via its **Dynamic Action Flows** and **AI Orchestration** components ([Aisera : Agentic AI for the Enterprise](https://aisera.com/#:~:text=,Security%20and%20Compliance)). In practice, this allows the AI to not only retrieve information but also **execute tasks across SaaS applications**. For example, it can interact with IT service management tools, CRM systems, or HR portals – creating tickets, updating records, or routing requests – much like a human agent following up on a query. These actions can be triggered through API integrations or even UI simulation if needed. Aisera’s platform is extensible, often integrating with popular enterprise apps (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, etc.). 
- **Browser and OS Interactions** – While Aisera primarily integrates at the API level, it can simulate user interactions when necessary. It partners with major collaboration and IT tools, and can operate via chat interfaces (Teams, Slack) to drive actions in other systems. For systems without direct integration, customers can leverage RPA alongside Aisera (the AI can hand off tasks to an RPA bot for GUI-based automation). Additionally, Aisera’s **Next Best Action** recommendations can guide agents or trigger automated scripts for remediation tasks ([Generative AI for State & Government Agencies](https://aisera.com/solutions/industries/government/#:~:text=AI)). In essence, it’s capable of orchestrating both cloud software actions and initiating **OS-level scripts** (e.g. running a diagnostic) through integrations with IT automation tools.
- **Data Privacy & Isolation** – Aisera strongly emphasizes that **customer data remains private**. Under its “TRAPS” trust framework (Trusted, Responsible, Auditable, Private, Secure), Aisera commits that your data **“remains yours”** – it does *not* access or use your organization's data to train outside models ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Ensure%20Data%20Confidentiality%20and%20Protect,User%20Privacy)). Each client’s data and sessions are isolated, and **no data is retained for training on shared models** ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=With%20Aisera%2C%20your%20data%20remains,and%20practices%20like%20PII%20anonymization)) ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Data%20Control%20%26%20User%20Consent)). This addresses the strict data isolation requirement: Aisera’s cloud instances keep data separated and only use it to serve that customer’s queries. It also supports PII anonymization and other governance to protect sensitive info ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Ensure%20Data%20Confidentiality%20and%20Protect,User%20Privacy)).
- **Security & Compliance** – Aisera is enterprise-grade: it supports SSO, encryption, role-based access, and complies with standards like SOC 2 and GDPR (as indicated on its Trust Center). While not publicly FedRAMP-authorized as of this writing, Aisera has **government clients** (e.g. City of Denver ([Aisera : Agentic AI for the Enterprise](https://aisera.com/#:~:text=,Snowflake))) and offers a *Government* industry solution with stringent data governance ([Generative AI for State & Government Agencies](https://aisera.com/solutions/industries/government/#:~:text=With%20the%20TRAPS%20framework%2C%20Aisera%E2%80%99s,trustworthy%20for%20public%20sector%20operations)). Its framework enforces compliance with data regulations and provides audit logs for all AI actions, which can assist in meeting requirements like HIPAA or ISO 27001. Organizations can deploy Aisera in a private cloud or VPC to ensure all data processing stays within approved boundaries. 

Overall, Aisera acts as a secure AI research and task agent across enterprise data, with a design that **prevents data leakage or reuse** and enables **browser-like automation** through its integrations and optional RPA combination.

## Glean Work AI Agents

**Glean** – known for its enterprise search platform – has introduced **Glean Agents**, a horizontal Work AI platform for building and deploying AI agents in the enterprise. Glean Agents are specifically crafted to access **both internal and external knowledge** and perform multi-step tasks, making them suitable for “deep research” use cases:

- **Unified Data Access (Internal + External)** – Glean’s Agents have “the industry’s broadest access to knowledge,” spanning enterprise structured and unstructured data *as well as* world internet data (historical and real-time) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=Now%20with%20the%20most%20complete,personal%20tasks%20and%20business%20processes)) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=%2A%20Real,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)). This means a Glean agent can, for example, search your internal SharePoint and knowledge bases **via semantic embeddings**, and also pull in relevant information from web search or external databases. Real-time internet search integration is built-in, enriching the agent’s answers with up-to-date external insights ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=%2A%20Real,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)). All retrieved information is verified and cited, which is critical for trust. 
- **Agentic Reasoning & Workflows** – Glean’s platform includes an **agentic reasoning engine** that allows agents to plan multi-step workflows and take actions, not just answer questions ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,a%20library%20of%20actions%20to)). Employees can create custom agents by describing goals in natural language (a **no-code agent builder**) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=re)). The system then auto-generates a complex sequence of steps to achieve the goal, which the user can refine. For instance, an employee could ask an agent to “gather all recent research on topic X and draft a summary email,” and the agent will search internal files, find web articles, aggregate findings, then compose an email draft. Glean provides a library of pre-built actions and an expanding library of connectors, so agents can log into apps, query databases, or invoke APIs as needed ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=Palo%20Alto%2C%20CA%20,every%20stage%20of%20customer%20adoption)) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)). 
- **SaaS and Tool Integrations** – With **100+ pre-built connectors**, Glean can interact with a wide range of SaaS solutions (from Salesforce and Slack to Atlassian, Databricks, and more) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,agent%20builder%2C%20agent%20orchestration%2C%20unified)). Agents can thus execute tasks like updating a CRM entry, creating a Jira ticket, or fetching analytics from BI tools – all through the same natural language interface. While Glean primarily uses direct integrations, it essentially *simulates human actions* on these apps (logging in via secure OAuth, performing the allowed operations). This covers the requirement of simulating user interactions with web apps. If a needed app lacks an API, custom integration or RPA could be used in tandem, though Glean’s focus is on native connectors.
- **Optional OS-Level Actions** – Glean Agents can analyze structured data and even run SQL queries or script-like operations (for example, via Databricks integration) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)). Direct OS command execution isn’t a primary feature, but an agent could be configured to trigger a script on an internal server (through an API call or webhook). Glean’s architecture is extensible, so organizations can define new “actions” that might include running a shell command on a secure server, if needed, through an intermediary service.
- **Security & Governance** – Glean places strong emphasis on **active data and AI governance**. It enforces permission checks on all data access (agents only retrieve data the user is authorized to see) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=external%20sources)). Its governance dashboard scans for sensitive data exposure and provides admins control over what data sources an agent can tap ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=external%20sources)). All interactions can be logged for audit. While not FedRAMP certified, Glean’s platform was built with enterprise security in mind – data stays within the customer’s cloud tenant, and Glean’s **“universal knowledge”** approach comes with controls to prevent leakage of confidential data ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=external%20sources)). For example, an admin can disable internet access for certain agents handling sensitive internal data. Glean supports major compliance needs (SOC 2, GDPR) and could be deployed in a private cloud configuration if required by an enterprise. 

In summary, Glean Agents provide a **comprehensive research assistant** that can scour internal and external sources and automate follow-up actions, all under a robust security governance model ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=external%20sources)). This makes it a strong COTS solution for organizations looking to leverage agentic AI while keeping data secure.

## IBM watsonx Orchestrate

**IBM watsonx Orchestrate** is a generative AI and automation solution enabling businesses to create personalized AI assistants and agents for workflow automation ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=watsonx%20Orchestrate%3A%20AI%20for%20business,productivity)). It’s a *platform toolkit* that organizations can host in their private cloud or on-premises (e.g., via IBM Cloud Pak or IBM Cloud for Government) to meet strict isolation requirements. Notable aspects:

- **Integration of AI and Automation Tools** – Watsonx Orchestrate is designed to **“connect to any AI model or automation tool”**, allowing flexible integration of both IBM and third-party services ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=IBM%C2%AE%20watsonx%E2%84%A2%20Orchestrate%C2%AE%20puts%20AI,and%20processes%20with%20generative%20AI)). This means it can use internal foundation models or even OpenAI/Anthropic models (if allowed) alongside connecting to RPA bots or existing scripts. For internal deep research, it can plug into an enterprise’s document repositories (leveraging IBM Watson Discovery or vector databases for semantic search) to find information, then utilize automation “skills” to act on that information. Essentially, Orchestrate provides a framework to build an AI agent with access to *both* knowledge (via AI search) and action capabilities.
- **Private Cloud Deployment (FedRAMP-ready)** – IBM has a long track record of supporting government and secure deployments. **IBM Cloud for Government** (IC4G) is FedRAMP High authorized ([IBM Cloud for Government and IBM SmartCloud for Government Meet FedRAMP High Security Requirements - IBM Blog](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ic4g-and-scg-meet-fedramp-high-security-requirements/#:~:text=IBM%20Cloud%20for%20Government%20,FedRAMP)), and Watsonx Orchestrate can be deployed in such an environment or in an AWS/Azure GovCloud. IBM also offers Orchestrate through **Cloud Pak for Data** for on-premises or VPC installation, ensuring **complete data isolation** (all data and model processing stays within the client’s controlled infrastructure). IBM’s FedRAMP-authorized cloud offerings mean agencies can use Orchestrate while meeting FedRAMP High security controls ([IBM Cloud for Government and IBM SmartCloud for Government Meet FedRAMP High Security Requirements - IBM Blog](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ic4g-and-scg-meet-fedramp-high-security-requirements/#:~:text=IBM%20Cloud%20for%20Government%20,FedRAMP)).
- **Deep Research Abilities** – Orchestrate allows building AI assistants that can perform complex queries on internal data. For instance, an HR agent could search across internal HR policies (using embeddings to understand context) and external legal databases to answer a compliance question. Because Orchestrate is part of IBM’s **watsonx** suite, it can leverage IBM’s large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. It doesn’t natively browse the public web, but if external research is needed, one can integrate a web search API or feed external data into the model. The platform’s strength lies in combining **NLP understanding** with enterprise automation – thus an agent can read a policy document, summarize it, then automatically draft an email or update a form as a follow-up.
- **Workflow and SaaS Automation** – IBM provides a **Skills Catalog** and “Skills Studio” to integrate common business actions (e.g., create ServiceNow ticket, update Salesforce record) ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=Orchestrator%20Agent%20AI%20assistant%20builder,Skills%20Studio%20Prebuilt%20skills%20catalog)) ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=Explore%20Orchestrator%20Agent)). Using a *low-code interface*, users can orchestrate multi-step workflows in natural language (“assistants in minutes—no coding required” ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=Explore%20Orchestrator%20Agent))). The agent can log into web apps or call APIs just like a human would – for example, an IT agent could reset a user’s password by invoking Active Directory commands, or a sales agent could retrieve the latest pricing from an internal database and send it to a client via email, all automatically. For applications without APIs, Orchestrate can integrate with **RPA bots** (IBM has an RPA solution, or it can trigger third-party RPA) to simulate UI interactions. This covers the requirement of interacting with SaaS via a browser when no direct integration is available.
- **OS-Level and Scripting Actions** – Because Orchestrate can **“seamlessly connect… to automation tools”** ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=generative%20AI)), it is capable of executing OS-level commands through those tools. For example, an agent could be configured to run a shell script or a batch process on a server by interfacing with an orchestration tool like Ansible or an RPA bot on that machine. IBM’s own automation portfolio (UrbanCode, Turbonomic, etc.) can be tied in, enabling infrastructure-level actions if needed. Thus, an AI agent could conceivably fetch data from logs or run diagnostic commands in response to a user request, under proper safeguards.
- **Security & Compliance** – IBM Watsonx Orchestrate inherits IBM’s enterprise-grade security practices. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and the platform supports access controls and audit logging. Running Orchestrate in a private instance means **no data is shared with IBM or any third-party** aside from what the user chooses to integrate. IBM’s models can be deployed such that they do not learn from interactions (no updates to the base model from user prompts unless explicitly enabled in a controlled way). IBM as a company is compliant with **SOC 2, ISO 27001**, etc., and for federal clients, the solution can be delivered under **FedRAMP High** via IBM’s cloud or a government cloud partner ([IBM Cloud for Government and IBM SmartCloud for Government Meet FedRAMP High Security Requirements - IBM Blog](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ic4g-and-scg-meet-fedramp-high-security-requirements/#:~:text=IBM%20Cloud%20for%20Government%20,FedRAMP)). This makes Watsonx Orchestrate suitable for even highly regulated environments that require strict data custody and zero leakage.

In essence, IBM Watsonx Orchestrate is a flexible agent platform that can be privately hosted, combining **deep semantic search**, **LLM reasoning**, and **powerful automation hooks** to accomplish research and tasks—while aligning with stringent security/compliance demands.

## Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP)

**Palantir AIP** is an *enterprise AI platform* focused on integrating large language models into organization-specific data and operations. Palantir’s solution is notable for high security environments (defense, government, finance) where data isolation is paramount. Key points:

- **Private Network Deployment** – AIP is explicitly designed to run **within an enterprise’s private network or cloud**, so LLM capabilities can be brought to sensitive data without exposing it externally ([Palantir Foundry AIP - Unit8](https://unit8.com/resources/palantir-foundry-aip/#:~:text=In%20April%202023%2C%20the%20company,integrated%20directly%20into%20the%20platform)). In Palantir’s architecture, the model (which can be an open-source LLM or a hosted model via API) is integrated in **Foundry**, Palantir’s data platform. All prompts and outputs are handled within the secure environment; if using a third-party model API, Palantir implements gateways to ensure no sensitive raw data is leaked in prompts ([AIP capabilities • Palantir](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/platform-overview/aip-capabilities//#:~:text=LLM%20security)) ([AIP capabilities • Palantir](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/platform-overview/aip-capabilities//#:~:text=To%20understand%20how%20LLMs%20securely,by%20selecting%20Palantir%20AIP%20FAQs)). (They provide documentation on how they securely process prompts with third-party LLMs, including encryption and optional on-prem deployment of models.)
- **FedRAMP High and Government-Grade Security** – Palantir’s Federal Cloud Service is **FedRAMP High** authorized, and this accreditation *“extends across Palantir’s entire product suite, including AIP”* ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=Management%20Program%20for%20its%20two,hosted%20offerings)). Palantir AIP can thus be used for **Impact Level 5/6** DoD data and other highly sensitive workloads ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)). Compliance-wise, Palantir meets a host of standards (FedRAMP, DoD IL6, FISMA High, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) ([Palantir Trust and Security Portal | Powered by SafeBase](https://palantir.safebase.us/?itemName=data_privacy&source=click#:~:text=PlusDISPDoD%20IL5DoD%20IL6ENSFedRAMP%20HighFISMA%20HighGDPRHIPAAISO,27018ISO%209001SOC%201SOC%202SOC%203TISAXVPAT)), making it one of the most compliance-ready AI platforms. Data is strictly isolated per customer/government tenant, and Palantir’s contracts often allow on-prem deployments (for instance, in classified networks) meaning absolutely no external data sharing. No AIP usage data is used to train any models by default – agencies can even use fully local models if required.
- **Deep Research Capabilities** – Palantir AIP allows organizations to apply LLM **“intuition”** to their private data ([Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/aip/#:~:text=Palantir%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Platform%20Explore,platform%20%C2%B7%20Time%3A%203%20mns)). This means an AIP agent can ingest and reason over large internal datasets (e.g. millions of records, reports, sensor logs) and combine that with external data that is brought into the secure environment. For example, an intelligence analyst could ask an AIP-powered system to gather and summarize all reports about a certain topic from internal databases, and also incorporate relevant news from curated external feeds (Palantir can pull in OSINT data feeds into Foundry). The agent can perform multi-step analysis: first querying a knowledge graph, then asking follow-up questions, etc., to produce a detailed report that normally would take human analysts days. Palantir calls these *“Deep Research”* or *analyst* workflows, and thanks to Palantir’s efficient backend, even very large queries can be handled quickly.
- **Action Orchestration (Tool Usage)** – A key differentiator of Palantir AIP is its focus on not just Q&A, but taking **actions based on AI reasoning**. AIP can integrate with operational systems – for instance, if an AIP agent in a military context determines that a certain pattern is a threat, it could suggest a response and even execute a predefined script to deploy resources (with human approval in the loop). Palantir’s platform supports creating secure “action nodes” that an LLM can trigger, with governance. This might include running a simulation, updating a database record, or calling an API in another system. There are guardrails – often a human must review actions before execution in high-stakes settings – but the capability for the AI to drive real-world changes exists (Palantir demonstrated an AI agent controlling a drone in a defense scenario, under supervision). For enterprise use, an AIP agent could automatically flag anomalies in data and then execute a containment script in a cybersecurity tool, for example.
- **Browser/SaaS Interaction** – While Palantir AIP doesn’t literally drive a web browser UI in the way RPA tools do, it achieves integration through its platform connectors. Palantir Foundry can connect to SaaS applications via APIs or data pipelines. Thus, if an analyst’s workflow needs data from a SaaS app, the AIP agent can query that app’s data via Foundry. If a direct integration is not available, Palantir’s approach would be to bring that data into Foundry (or use something like **Palantir FedStart** for partners to integrate SaaS securely ([Palantir FedStart - Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/palantirtechnologies1585670280063.palantir_fedstart?tab=overview#:~:text=Palantir%20FedStart%20,of%20the%20time%20and%20cost))). For one-off web research needs (like reading a specific webpage), an AIP user might use a separate secure browsing tool and feed the text to the AI. However, for structured interactions, Palantir would maintain a controlled interface rather than letting the AI freely roam the internet (to preserve security). In summary, AIP emphasizes **controlled, auditable tool use** over open-ended browser automation.
- **OS-Level and Custom Commands** – Palantir’s platform can execute code and pipelines. An AIP agent can invoke custom Python or SQL as part of a solution (for instance, using the “Use LLM” node in a data pipeline to generate results ([AIP capabilities • Palantir](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/platform-overview/aip-capabilities//#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20with%20permission%2C%20you%20can,Builder%2C%20such%20as%20the%20following))). If OS-level actions are needed, Palantir Apollo can deploy code to systems, so an agent could trigger a pre-defined deployment or script execution in the enterprise environment. Everything is logged and must be pre-configured by developers, which ensures no unexpected system commands are run without oversight.

In summary, Palantir AIP is a **highly secure, compliant AI agent platform** that embeds LLMs into enterprise workflows ([Palantir Foundry AIP - Unit8](https://unit8.com/resources/palantir-foundry-aip/#:~:text=In%20April%202023%2C%20the%20company,integrated%20directly%20into%20the%20platform)). It excels in scenarios requiring strict data governance, offering powerful deep-research analytics and the ability to act on insights in real systems (with robust safety checks). Its FedRAMP High authorization and use in defense contexts attest to its security pedigree ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)).

## RPA-Based AI Agents (UiPath, Automation Anywhere, etc.)

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) platforms are another category of solution that can fulfill the “agentic research” requirements when augmented with AI. Tools like **UiPath**, **Automation Anywhere**, and **Microsoft Power Automate** have begun integrating large language models to create AI-driven agents capable of both web navigation and OS-level actions. For example, **UiPath** – a leading RPA vendor – now offers an AI-powered automation cloud that is **FedRAMP-authorized** for government use ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=New%20York%2C%20NY%2C%20March%2026%2C,accessed%20by%20federal%20government%20agencies)). Key characteristics of RPA-based approaches:

- **Browser and Application Simulation** – RPA bots excel at **simulating human interactions in GUIs**. They can control a web browser (click links, fill forms, press buttons) and desktop applications just like a person would. By incorporating an LLM as a “brain”, an RPA bot can decide *what* actions to take on the fly. This directly meets the requirement of interacting with SaaS via a browser with human-like behavior. For instance, an AI-augmented RPA agent could log into a web-based ERP system, navigate to a report section, download data, and then analyze it with an LLM. UiPath and others have shown demos of using GPT-4 to interpret instructions and drive RPA workflows ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)).
- **Internal and External Data Access** – RPA can interface with internal systems (databases, legacy apps, fileshares) and also scrape data from external websites. While traditional RPA had no built-in “semantic search”, adding an LLM means the agent can parse unstructured data it encounters. We can script RPA to call internal APIs or use an **embedding-based search** on documents (for example, using an open-source vector search within an automation script) – effectively giving the RPA agent the ability to perform *deep research* across internal knowledge. For external info, the RPA can query search engines or open web pages and let the LLM read them. One could integrate an official API (like Bing Search API) or simply automate a browser-based search.
- **Private Cloud Deployment** – Most RPA solutions can be deployed on-premises or in a private cloud. UiPath, for example, offers an **Automation Cloud for Public Sector** that is FedRAMP Moderate and can be run in GovCloud ([About Automation Cloud Public Sector - UiPath Documentation](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-cloud-public-sector/automation-cloud-public-sector/latest/admin-guide/about-automation-cloud-public-sector#:~:text=About%20Automation%20Cloud%20Public%20Sector,mandated%20by%20the%20Federal)). Agencies can also run UiPath entirely on their own VMs for complete control. This means the AI-driven RPA agent’s **execution and data** stay within the organization’s infrastructure. No data needs to be sent to an external LLM service if using a self-hosted model; alternatively, if using a cloud LLM (like Azure OpenAI), that can be done within a FedRAMP-certified environment ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=New%20York%2C%20NY%2C%20March%2026%2C,accessed%20by%20federal%20government%20agencies)). 
- **Data Isolation & Non-Training** – When running RPA locally (or in a dedicated cloud instance), **no interaction data is shared** beyond the organization. If an external LLM API is used, most vendors (Microsoft, OpenAI via Azure) have options to disable data logging and training on prompts. In the case of UiPath’s AI, it combines **Generative AI and Specialized AI** in a way that keeps the data safe – government clients’ automations run in a segregated cloud with no leakage ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=As%20an%20authorized%20provider%20of,of%20international%20public%20sector%20organizations)). Thus, an RPA-based agent can be configured to satisfy strict isolation: all web traffic from the agent can go through secure gateways, and all logs can be kept in-house.
- **OS-Level Commands** – RPA’s core strength is interacting with the operating system. An AI agent built on RPA can easily execute OS commands, run scripts, manipulate files, or launch programs as part of its workflow. For example, an agent could receive a request to “generate a compliance report,” and it might run a SQL script on a local database, then open Excel to create a spreadsheet, and finally email it – all of which involve OS-level operations orchestrated by the bot. The addition of the LLM allows the agent to handle unexpected situations (like a pop-up window) intelligently by “reading” the screen and deciding how to close it or by adjusting its plan. 
- **COTS Availability** – UiPath and Automation Anywhere are **commercial platforms available off-the-shelf** with enterprise support. They now include AI capabilities (UiPath has an AI Center and integrations for GPT models). Microsoft’s Power Automate with **Copilot** is another example, allowing natural language to create automation flows. These are established vendors with compliance attestations (SOC 2, ISO 27018, and now FedRAMP for some), making them acceptable for enterprise and government adoption.

In summary, an RPA-based solution can serve as an *“embodied” AI agent*, directly interacting with apps and systems. When combined with an internal knowledge base and LLM reasoning, it meets all listed requirements: it can search across data sources, run in a secured environment, maintain data isolation, use a browser like a human, and execute OS commands. The trade-off is that assembling such an agent might require more configuration (to define the steps and integrate the LLM) compared to purpose-built AI platforms. However, for organizations that already use RPA, this approach leverages existing infrastructure and adds intelligence to it.

## Open-Source Frameworks (e.g. SambaNova/CrewAI Deep Research Agent)

In addition to COTS products, there are open-source frameworks that enable building a custom agentic research platform meeting all the requirements. One notable example is the **open-source deep research agent framework** announced by SambaNova in partnership with CrewAI ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=3,increasing%20exponentially%2C%20especially%20with%20OpenAI)) ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=Today%20SambaNova%20has%20answered%20the,enterprises%20solve%20their%20biggest%20challenges)):

- **Enterprise Data + External Web** – This framework was designed to let enterprises build their own multi-agent system with access to both private data and the public internet ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=1,increasing%20exponentially%2C%20especially%20with%20OpenAI)). It supports **retrieval-augmented generation**: agents can perform semantic searches on internal documents (using embeddings) and also issue web search queries or scrape websites for information. For instance, an enterprise can configure an agent that first queries an internal knowledge base and then searches the web for any missing pieces, compiling a comprehensive answer with citations (similar to how tools like Perplexity.ai work, but now under the enterprise’s full control).
- **On-Premises Deployment** – As an open-source solution, it can be deployed fully on-prem or in a private cloud, even leveraging specialized hardware (SambaNova’s AI systems) for acceleration ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=Today%20SambaNova%20has%20answered%20the,enterprises%20solve%20their%20biggest%20challenges)). **All data stays within the company’s environment.** This addresses security: none of the prompts or documents need to go to an outside service. The agents can use open-source LLMs (like Meta’s LLaMA family or others) hosted locally, ensuring **no external API calls** that might leak data. SambaNova highlights that this approach keeps *“enterprise data... private on-premise”* which was a limitation with many cloud-based research tools ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=1,increasing%20exponentially%2C%20especially%20with%20OpenAI)).
- **No Data Retention/Training** – Because you’re running the models yourself (or using an open model), there is zero risk of your data being used to train someone else’s model. The open agents can be configured not to store conversation history unless you choose. In essence, **data isolation is guaranteed by design** – your data never leaves your infrastructure and the models can be static (not continually trained on new inputs unless you want to fine-tune them internally). This was a key motivation: to eliminate security concerns that *“existing deep research tools”* couldn’t address ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=1,increasing%20exponentially%2C%20especially%20with%20OpenAI)).
- **Tool Use and OS Interaction** – Open-source agent frameworks like **CrewAI** allow the creation of various tool-using agents. For example, an agent can be equipped with a **browser tool**, an **HTTP request tool**, a **shell command tool**, etc. This means the agent can simulate a user on a browser (via a headless browsing library or API calls) and execute OS commands directly in a controlled sandbox. In the CrewAI deep research example, they set up agents like a general search agent, a focused research agent, and even a financial analysis agent ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=The%20framework%20by%20default%20comes,own%20data%20source%20as%20well)) ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=After%20getting%20some%20basic%20information%2C,the%20number%20of%20tokens%20required)). The agents can take a query, break it into sub-tasks (search, analyze, compile), and even run code if needed to compute something. With open frameworks, there’s full flexibility to script what the agent can do – including running Python scripts, calling database queries, or any OS-level operation you permit. This satisfies the optional OS interaction criterion fully: you have the freedom to grant the agent shell access (often done in a sandbox or via plugins that execute commands).
- **Extendibility and Custom Actions** – Being open source, these frameworks are **highly extensible**. You can add connectors to your internal systems (APIs, databases) or define new “tools” for the agent (e.g., a Salesforce API tool or a VMware control tool). CrewAI, for instance, is independent of proprietary agent libraries and lets developers add new agents or tools easily ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=Research%20agent%2C%20and%20a%20Financial,own%20data%20source%20as%20well)). This means you can tailor the agent to your enterprise’s unique mix of data sources and applications – a level of customization often not possible in closed platforms.
- **Performance and Costs** – SambaNova reported that running these agents on their hardware or optimized cloud can be **3× faster and significantly cheaper** than using API-based models ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=Today%20SambaNova%20has%20answered%20the,enterprises%20solve%20their%20biggest%20challenges)) ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=faster%20than%20any%20other%20GPU,4o)). While performance isn’t directly a security requirement, it does matter for practical use (faster research turnaround and the ability to iterate quickly). Moreover, using local models avoids recurring token costs that come with API calls ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=faster%20than%20any%20other%20GPU,4o)). Lower cost encourages more extensive use of deep research agents without budget concern, which can indirectly increase adoption in secure environments (where budget cycles can be tight).

Other open-source options in this vein include **LangChain** (a popular framework for chaining LLM calls and tools) and **AutoGPT/BabyAGI** style agents, which can be self-hosted. These require engineering effort to set up and harden, but they can meet all the specified requirements if configured correctly. For instance, one could deploy an **AutoGPT** agent with a local LLM (ensuring data never leaves), hook it up to an internal vector database for semantic search, give it access to a headless Chrome for web browsing, and whitelist certain OS commands it can run. This would achieve deep research and multi-step task execution similar to the commercial platforms – though without the out-of-the-box user interface and support that vendors provide.

**Security Considerations for Open Source**: When rolling your own agent, it’s crucial to implement sandboxing and permissioning (so the AI doesn’t execute destructive actions). Enterprise users often run open-source AI agents in isolated network enclaves, with access only to approved internal APIs or a proxy for web access, to maintain security. The advantage is you have **full transparency** into the code, and you can enforce any policy (for example, log every tool use, require confirmation for certain actions, etc.). Many enterprises experimenting with this route use open models like **Meta LLaMA 2** or **Falcon** which are permitted for commercial use and can be deployed in-house – thus no data is shared and even the model weights stay under company control.

---

**In conclusion**, the landscape of agentic deep research platforms includes both **enterprise-ready solutions** and **open frameworks** that can be adapted. Platforms like Moveworks, Aisera, Glean, IBM Orchestrate, and Palantir AIP offer robust COTS options with varying focuses (from IT service automation to general knowledge agents), all emphasizing security measures such as data encryption, role-based access, and compliance certifications. Many are already used in government or highly regulated industries, evidenced by FedRAMP authorizations and similar standards ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=New%20York%2C%20NY%2C%20March%2026%2C,accessed%20by%20federal%20government%20agencies)) ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)). These solutions can search internal data semantically and reach out to external sources (either via built-in web search integrations or configurable connectors), then synthesize results using LLMs. They also provide mechanisms to perform actions – whether via API, RPA, or direct tool integration – essentially *simulating a human researcher or operator*.

When strict data isolation is a must, deploying the AI in a private cloud or on-premises environment ensures no sensitive information ever leaves your control. All the above solutions support such deployment models, and they **do not retain or reuse your data for training** their models (either by policy, as with enterprise SaaS like Aisera ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Ensure%20Data%20Confidentiality%20and%20Protect,User%20Privacy)), or by the architecture of a self-hosted model). This guarantees that your proprietary data or research queries won’t leak into public AI model training.

Finally, for organizations willing to invest in customization, open-source agent frameworks (or a combination of RPA + LLM) provide a path to meet these requirements without vendor lock-in. The choice may come down to **build vs. buy**: COTS platforms offer faster time-to-value and support, whereas open source offers maximal control and privacy. In either case, the capabilities of deep research across internal/external data, secure private-cloud hosting, no data leakage, rich integration with SaaS, and OS-level action execution are all achievable today with the state of AI agents and automation. The examples and platforms cited above illustrate that this is not theoretical – multiple solutions already **deliver on these requirements** in production settings, enabling powerful AI-driven research while keeping data secure and compliant.
