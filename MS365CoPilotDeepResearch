# Over-utilized statements

Carefully review and identify over-utilized statements which may indicate a superficial understanding of the subject matter.

These instances of ambiguous language suggest that while many features of Microsoft 365 Copilot are well-defined and currently available, there are several areas where future capabilities or enhancements are less certain or still in the planning stages.

1. "Support for Microsoft Graph Connectors to index third-party repositories is planned for CY2025." - The use of "planned" suggests uncertainty about the exact implementation timeline.

2. "Power Platform connectors to query data from various business apps are announced for 2025." - Similar to the above, "announced for" indicates a future plan without a firm commitment.

3. "Comprehensive citation generation in multiple formats (APA, MLA, Chicago) is not yet available." - The phrase "not yet available" implies uncertainty about when or if this feature will be implemented.

4. "Personalized prompting features for setting formatting and style preferences" are described as "planned" without a specific timeline.

5. "Sound like me" feature for email drafting is mentioned as planned for early 2024, but without a firm commitment.

6. "Integration with Microsoft Purview for enhanced compliance auditing is planned for Q1 2025." - Again, "planned for" indicates a future intention without certainty.

7. "Microsoft is also preparing Copilot readiness and usage reports (coming in 2025) for admins" - The parenthetical "coming in 2025" suggests a tentative timeline.

8. "API plugins (built on OpenAPI specifications) so that these custom agents can perform actions or retrieve data via external REST APIs" - The document states these are supported but only in the context of custom "declarative agents," indicating uncertainty about broader implementation.

9. "Some speculative future capabilities might include even more proactive assistance" - The use of "speculative" and "might" clearly indicates uncertainty about these potential features.

10. "Voice interaction (speaking to Copilot during meetings or through Cortana-like scenarios – voice input isn't explicitly in Copilot yet, but given Teams supports live transcripts and Windows has voice, one could envision this later)" - This entire statement is speculative, using phrases like "one could envision" to indicate uncertainty.

After reviewing the research approach and over-utilized statements, here are some questions we could ask in future deep research to obtain more fine-grained results:

1. What specific third-party repositories will Microsoft Graph Connectors support in CY2025, and are there any beta or preview versions available earlier?

2. Which Power Platform connectors are prioritized for the 2025 release, and are there any phased rollout plans?

3. What citation formats are currently supported by Microsoft 365 Copilot, and is there a roadmap for adding more formats?

4. Can you provide details on the personalization options being developed for Copilot, including any beta testing or preview features?

5. What specific capabilities will the "Sound like me" feature include, and are there any early adopter programs?

6. What compliance standards will the Microsoft Purview integration specifically address, and are there any interim compliance measures in place?

7. What metrics will be included in the Copilot readiness and usage reports, and will there be any preview versions available before 2025?

8. What types of actions and data retrieval will be possible with the API plugins for custom agents, and are there any use case examples available?

9. Are there any prototype features or internal testing results that hint at future proactive assistance capabilities?

10. What voice interaction features are currently in development for Copilot, and how do they integrate with existing voice capabilities in Microsoft 365?

11. Are there any plans to expand Copilot's language support beyond English, and if so, what languages are prioritized?

12. How is Microsoft addressing potential bias in Copilot's outputs, and what safeguards are in place?

13. What specific performance metrics is Microsoft using to measure Copilot's impact on productivity?

14. How is Microsoft planning to integrate Copilot with industry-specific workflows and tools?

15. What security measures are in place to protect sensitive information processed by Copilot, especially in collaborative environments?

These more specific questions should help gather detailed information about Copilot's current capabilities, development roadmap, and future plans, allowing for a more nuanced alignment between research material and individual questions.

### Deep Research Response

Understood. I will conduct a detailed evaluation of Microsoft 365 Co-Pilot’s research and iterative writing capabilities, categorizing each of the 60 capabilities as Available, Planned, or Speculative based on Microsoft’s official documentation, blog announcements, and whitepapers. When necessary, I will reference independent analyst reviews and media reports, ensuring that speculation is clearly labeled. The final response will be a densely written paper in plain text format, ensuring that all findings are comprehensive and well-supported. I will get back to you once the research is complete.

Microsoft 365 Copilot tightly integrates large language models with organizational data and Office apps to support a broad range of research and iterative writing capabilities. **Integration with enterprise data** is a core strength: Copilot has real-time access to the Microsoft Graph (emails, files, meetings, chats, etc.), grounding its responses in the user’s own context while respecting established permissions ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=connecting%20LLMs%20to%20your%20business,deliver%20accurate%2C%20relevant%2C%20contextual%20responses)). This functionality is **currently available**, meaning today Copilot can retrieve and synthesize information only from data the user has access to, ensuring any answers or content it generates are anchored in relevant internal sources ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=make%20Copilot%20the%20AI%20solution,you%20can%20trust)). Copilot also incorporates **web data through Bing** for up-to-date research. In its chat interface (“Copilot Chat”), it can pull current information from the internet and even provide cited sources for verification ([Microsoft Copilot | Information Technology](https://www.it.psu.edu/services/office365/microsoft-copilot/#:~:text=%23%20Up)). This web-grounding is **available now** – essentially Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat includes Bing Chat Enterprise capabilities, allowing users to ask general knowledge questions or gather external facts with source citations as part of their research workflow ([Microsoft Copilot | Information Technology](https://www.it.psu.edu/services/office365/microsoft-copilot/#:~:text=%23%20Up)). By contrast, integrating _external enterprise_ data (beyond Microsoft 365) is on the roadmap: support for **Microsoft Graph Connectors** (to index third-party repositories into the semantic knowledge index) is **planned for CY2025**, which will expand Copilot’s ability to retrieve content from connected external sources ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Microsoft%20Graph%20Connectors%20Connect%20external,Yes%20Coming%20CY25)). Similarly, **Power Platform connectors** will enable Copilot to query real-time data from myriad business apps (Salesforce, ServiceNow, etc.) via the growing connector catalog, an **announced feature coming in 2025** ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Power%20Platform%20,7)). These upcoming integrations are expected to broaden Copilot’s research capabilities by pulling in data from outside the immediate Microsoft 365 environment (currently this remains **planned** and not yet generally available).

For **data parsing and extraction**, Microsoft 365 Copilot already demonstrates strong capabilities that are **currently available** in preview and initial release. In Word, for example, Copilot can instantly **summarize long documents** or distill key points, helping users extract essential information from large reports ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Feature%20Description%20Cloud%20environment%20,you%20turn%20your%20ideas%20into)). This summarization functionality is live now, enabling research workflows where users can have Copilot comprehend and explain lengthy content or highlight insights. In Excel, Copilot can **analyze spreadsheet data, find trends, and extract key insights** in plain language ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20Excel%20Copilot%20in,8)), turning raw data into a narrative – a capability available in the current version. It can even generate visualizations or suggest charts to communicate data findings ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20Excel%20Copilot%20in,8)), effectively handling the extraction of trends and the creation of graphs in one go (these Excel analysis features are **already available** with Copilot in Excel). A related ability in Word is to transform unstructured text into structured formats – for instance, Copilot can **visualize text by converting it into a table** on command ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Feature%20Description%20Cloud%20environment%20,you%20turn%20your%20ideas%20into)). This text-to-table conversion feature is **live now**, providing flexible data formatting as part of iterative document editing. On the other hand, some advanced parsing abilities are forthcoming: **Copilot in OneDrive** will allow users to select multiple files (up to five) and get an AI-generated summary or comparison without manually opening them, which is **announced as “coming soon”** ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20OneDrive%20Copilot%20in,how%20users%20adoption%2C%20retention%2C%20and)). This will extend Copilot’s extraction capability to multi-document analysis, a boon for research scenarios like comparing different reports or synthesizing information across files (currently this multi-file summarization is **planned** but not yet released broadly). Another upcoming feature is **Copilot in Microsoft Stream** (for video), which will let users ask questions about video transcripts or get a summary of a recorded meeting or lecture ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=content%2C%20and%20catching%20up%20where,you%20kickstart%20and%20accelerate%20your)). This is **already available in the worldwide service (with GCC rollout planned Q1 2025)**, meaning in practice that Copilot can presently parse video transcript data to fetch information in seconds ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=content%2C%20and%20catching%20up%20where,you%20kickstart%20and%20accelerate%20your)). Together, these capabilities show that Copilot can integrate with various data types – text, numbers, even video – performing parsing and extraction tasks that aid research. The foundation behind these abilities is the **Semantic Index** that Microsoft automatically builds from Graph content: it semantically maps user and company data to make search and retrieval more contextually relevant ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Grounded%20in%20your%20business%20data,deliver%20accurate%2C%20relevant%2C%20contextual%20responses)). This index (enabled by default for enterprise tenants) is **currently in use** to help Copilot quickly find the right information when formulating answers, significantly enhancing its research prowess by understanding content meaning rather than relying on keyword search ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Grounded%20in%20your%20business%20data,deliver%20accurate%2C%20relevant%2C%20contextual%20responses)).

In terms of **user interaction and customization**, Microsoft 365 Copilot provides an intuitive natural-language interface across the Office suite, and these interaction features are largely **available now**. Users can engage with Copilot as a conversational agent beside their content – for example, asking Copilot in Word to refine a paragraph, or querying Copilot in Teams chat about a project update – all through simple prompts. The experience is designed to be consistent and familiar in each app, maintaining a unified look and feel for prompts and commands ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Integrated%20into%20the%20apps%20millions,for%20prompts%2C%20refinements%20and%20commands)). Copilot supports **iterative multi-turn conversations**: after an initial prompt, users can ask follow-up questions or request modifications, and Copilot remembers the context within that session to refine its output. This iterative refinement is a key part of the writing process that Copilot already facilitates – you can generate a first draft and then instruct Copilot to adjust the tone, shorten or expand sections, or incorporate additional details in subsequent prompts ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Unleash%20creativity,can%20analyze%20trends%20and%20create)). This functionality is **currently available** and is central to Copilot’s value as an “iterative writing” assistant. Users remain in control, deciding what suggestions to keep or discard, and can continually tweak Copilot’s output by providing further guidance ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Unleash%20creativity,can%20analyze%20trends%20and%20create)). Copilot also offers built-in **tone and style customization** controls: for instance, when drafting emails in Outlook or messages in Teams, Copilot can adapt the tone (professional, casual, etc.) as instructed, ensuring the content matches the user’s intent ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20Teams%20Copilot%20in,users%20start%20their%20AI%20journey)). This capability is available now, allowing users to easily shift the voice of a draft (such as asking, “Make this sound more friendly”) without manual editing. In addition, Microsoft has introduced a **Copilot Prompt Gallery** to improve usability – a curated list of sample prompts and scenarios that users can choose from or adapt ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=suits%20your%20needs,Yes%20Yes)). This gallery is **already available**, helping new users get started by suggesting effective prompt patterns (and even allowing saving or sharing favorite prompts to encourage best practices ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20Prompt%20Gallery%20Copilot%20Prompt,Use%20Copilot%20in%20Loop%20for))). While Copilot’s default behavior is already helpful, Microsoft is expanding customization further: **personalized prompting and preferences** are **planned**. New capabilities rolling out initially in Word and PowerPoint will let users provide Copilot with details about their role, and set preferences for formatting, length, or writing style ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20bringing%20more%20personalization%20to,and%20voice%20when%20drafting%20emails)). In effect, users will be able to configure Copilot to tailor its responses – for example, always using a certain report format or favoring a concise style – reflecting individual or departmental conventions. This feature is not yet generally available but was announced (at Ignite 2023) as an upcoming enhancement to make Copilot’s outputs even more bespoke ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20bringing%20more%20personalization%20to,and%20voice%20when%20drafting%20emails)). Another major personalization feature on the horizon is **“Sound like me”** for Outlook, which will allow Copilot to draft emails in a way that mimics the user’s own writing voice ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=personalization%20features%20such%20as%20%E2%80%9Csound,and%20voice%20when%20drafting%20emails)). Microsoft demonstrated this as a forthcoming capability that matches your unique phrasing and tone, so that Copilot’s suggested emails read as if you wrote them. This is **planned for early 2024** ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=match%20at%20L354%20,quickly%20and%20show%20up%20prepped)), and represents an advanced form of iterative writing assistance – leveraging AI to capture subtleties of an individual’s style. Beyond these, Microsoft 365 Copilot can be extended and customized at a deeper level through **Copilot Studio**, a toolkit introduced in preview that lets organizations build their own copilots or “agents.” Using Copilot Studio (a low-code platform), developers or power users can create custom conversational AI agents that plug into Copilot – for example, an agent specialized in answering HR policy questions or assisting with IT support – effectively enhancing Copilot with domain-specific skills ([Customize Copilot and Create Agents | Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio#:~:text=Copilot%20Studio%20offers%20a%20graphical,with%20Microsoft%20conversational%20AI%20tools)) ([Customize Copilot and Create Agents | Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio#:~:text=What%20is%20Microsoft%20Copilot%20Studio%3F)). This extensibility is **planned/currently in preview** (not yet generally available to all customers), but Microsoft has made it clear that custom agent creation and plugin integration are a key part of the Copilot vision. In fact, Copilot Studio supports **API plugins** (built on OpenAPI specifications) so that these custom agents can perform actions or retrieve data via external REST APIs ([API plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-api-plugins#:~:text=In%20this%20article)) ([API plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-api-plugins#:~:text=API%20plugins%20are%20only%20supported,enabled%20in%20Microsoft%20365%20Copilot)). For example, a finance team could have an agent that connects to a budgeting system: the user could ask a question in natural language, and behind the scenes the Copilot agent calls the external API and returns the result in the answer ([API plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-api-plugins#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20consider%20a%20budgets,making%20the%20following%20API%20call)) ([API plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-api-plugins#:~:text=The%20prompt%20,to%20the%20following%20API%20call)). This shows the potential for **conversational actions** – Copilot not just writing text, but executing operations (querying databases, creating records, etc.) via plugins. Currently, such API plugins are **supported only in the context of these custom “declarative agents” built with Copilot Studio, not in the out-of-the-box Copilot** ([API plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-api-plugins#:~:text=Important)). So this is an emerging, **planned** capability: the infrastructure is being laid for Copilot to interact with third-party systems, but an end user cannot yet ask the default Microsoft 365 Copilot to, say, update a CRM record unless an admin has deployed a custom agent with that plugin. Nonetheless, it signals that **further customization and integration** is on the way, moving beyond today’s prompt-based adjustments toward full extensibility.

Focusing on Copilot’s **core research and analysis functionalities**, we find many features already in place and a few on the horizon. Copilot serves as a research assistant by leveraging both internal and external knowledge. For example, **conversational Q&A** is a fundamental capability: a user can ask Copilot questions about a project or document and get synthesized answers drawing on relevant files or emails. In Microsoft Teams or the standalone Business Chat experience, Copilot can answer open-ended questions by pulling context from multiple sources – “What did we decide about the budget in last week’s meeting?” – and the answer will be backed by the user’s Graph data (meeting transcripts, chats, documents) ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=But%20Copilot%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20just%20supercharge,work%20account%2C%20or%20from%20Teams)). This cross-domain reasoning is **currently available**, enabling research tasks that previously required manually searching through various files. Similarly, in OneNote, Copilot can be queried on notes to provide deeper insights or answer questions on the content ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20OneNote%20Copilot%20in%20OneNote,Your%20single)) – effectively acting like a smart research aide that’s read all your notes. These Q&A and content comprehension capabilities are present now, though they depend on the quality and permissions of data in the Graph. When it comes to creative research tasks, Copilot also excels at **brainstorming and ideation**. Users can prompt Copilot to generate ideas, for instance “Suggest some campaign slogans for product X,” or to help outline a document or plan. This **conversational brainstorming** feature is available (Copilot can produce lists of ideas or approaches to a problem in Word, Teams chat, etc.), leveraging the generative power of GPT-4 to unblock the creative process ([Microsoft Copilot | Information Technology](https://www.it.psu.edu/services/office365/microsoft-copilot/#:~:text=,brainstorm%20ideas%2C%20and%20refine%20writing)). Microsoft even markets Copilot as a way to “never start with a blank page” ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Unleash%20creativity,can%20analyze%20trends%20and%20create)) – it will provide a first draft or outline that the user can then iterate on. Indeed, Copilot can **generate structured outlines** for complex topics. In Word or in the Copilot Chat interface, if you ask for an outline of a research paper or a proposal, Copilot can produce a hierarchically organized set of points. (For web-based research, Copilot in Edge – essentially the Bing Chat – has been shown creating outlines from web sources ([Make Writing Your Next Research Paper Easier with AI - Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/learning-center/ai-help-with-research-papers?form=MA13I2#:~:text=Microsoft%20www,By)), indicating that the same underlying capability to structure information exists in Microsoft 365 Copilot when tasked with outline generation, available via the chat interface that has web grounding). On the data analysis side, Copilot turns natural language questions into insights. In Excel, users can ask for an analysis (e.g., “What are the top sales trends this quarter?”) and Copilot will utilize Excel’s features to answer – this might include generating formulas, running calculations, and then explaining the results in plain English ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20Excel%20Copilot%20in,8)). The ability to write or suggest **formulas** or transformations from a user’s description is **available**: Copilot in Excel can create formulas or even Python code (as discussed below) to meet a requested analysis. Microsoft describes that Copilot “unlocks Excel’s full capabilities” for anyone ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20Excel%20Copilot%20in,8)) – meaning tasks like creating a complex formula, performing a regression analysis, or building a PivotTable can be accomplished just by asking Copilot, rather than knowing the exact Excel commands. For instance, if a user asks “Calculate the correlation between column A and B,” Copilot can insert the appropriate formula or perform that analysis on the data. These analytical functions are part of the current Copilot in Excel feature set (now generally available). An exciting enhancement here is the integration of **Python in Excel**, which Microsoft recently announced and started rolling out. Excel now supports running Python scripts for advanced analytics, and Microsoft has confirmed that **Copilot will be able to leverage Python in Excel via natural language** ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=matches%20your%20unique%20writing%20style,and%20voice%20when%20drafting%20emails)) ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=The%20recently%20announced%20Python%20in,this%20capability%20using%20natural%20language)). This means a user could ask a high-level question that requires sophisticated analysis – for example, performing a statistical test or generating a visualization beyond Excel’s native charts – and Copilot could execute a Python script behind the scenes to fulfill the request. This integration is **planned** (the blog indicates users “will be able to unlock [Python in Excel] using natural language” with Copilot ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=matches%20your%20unique%20writing%20style,and%20voice%20when%20drafting%20emails))). As Python in Excel itself is already available to users, we can expect Copilot’s support for it to follow suit, moving this capability from planned to available in the near future. Another core analysis feature is Copilot’s ability to **identify trends and insights** without being explicitly asked for a specific metric. If given a dataset, Copilot can surface noteworthy patterns (e.g., “Sales spiked in July due to product launch” or “Region X has the highest growth”) on its own initiative when asked for a summary ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20Excel%20Copilot%20in,8)). This proactive insight extraction is **currently** part of Copilot’s analytical output in Excel and in data-linked chats. It turns raw data into a narrative of findings, which is immensely valuable for research and decision-making. For more qualitative analysis, Copilot helps users **synthesize information across multiple documents or sources**. For example, Business Chat can produce a briefing or report that combines data from a recent meeting, an email thread, and a document – something “you’ve never been able to do before,” as Microsoft noted when introducing Business Chat ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Copilot%20is%20integrated%20into%20Microsoft,meetings%2C%20emails%20and%20chat%20threads)). This cross-source synthesis is **available now** as part of the Business Chat experience: by providing a natural language prompt that describes the needed output, Copilot can draw on all relevant content in the user’s Graph context to assemble a coherent analysis or update. This essentially creates a new knowledge model for the organization by making previously siloed information accessible and cross-referenced in a single answer ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=But%20Copilot%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20just%20supercharge,work%20account%2C%20or%20from%20Teams)). On the horizon, Microsoft’s plan to allow **deeper third-party data querying** through connectors (as mentioned) will further amplify Copilot’s research capabilities – e.g., querying CRM or ERP data in the same conversational manner – but those are still **upcoming** features. Overall, Copilot’s core research functionality – finding information, answering questions, analyzing data, generating insights – is largely **present today** and is continually being enhanced as more data sources and skills (like Python) are added.

When it comes to **report generation and formatting flexibility**, Microsoft 365 Copilot already acts as a powerful content generator, and many of these capabilities are **currently available**. In Word, Copilot can **draft entire documents from scratch** based on a brief prompt or a few keywords, saving hours in initial writing tasks ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Unleash%20creativity,can%20analyze%20trends%20and%20create)). For instance, you can ask Copilot, “Write a two-page project proposal about X,” and it will produce a structured draft complete with an introduction, headings, and even a summary of key points – giving the user a solid starting point for iterative refinement. This first-draft generation is available now in Word’s Copilot (as part of the private previews and enterprise deployments, which are now generally expanding). Once a draft exists, Copilot helps to **refine and elevate the writing**. Users can prompt it to rewrite sections for clarity or persuasiveness, add detail or remove fluff, change the tone, or even improve grammar. These refinement functions (summarized by Microsoft as “create, summarize, comprehend, refine, and elevate” documents) are core to Copilot in Word’s design ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Feature%20Description%20Cloud%20environment%20,you%20turn%20your%20ideas%20into)) and are **currently present**. For example, you might tell Copilot “In this paragraph, make the tone more formal and add a financial example,” and it will edit the text accordingly. Copilot also excels at transforming content between formats. A standout capability **available now** is turning a document into a presentation. Copilot in PowerPoint can take an existing Word document (or even just a prompt outline) and **generate a complete slide deck** from it ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=your%20document.%20Yes%20Yes,full%20capabilities%20so%20you%20can)). It uses AI to create slides with titles, bullet points, and even speaker notes, pulling in relevant content from the source material. Impressively, it also includes **source references** in speaker notes when it uses content from an existing document ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=your%20document.%20Yes%20Yes,full%20capabilities%20so%20you%20can)), which helps in verifying accuracy and maintaining traceability. This feature means a user doing research can write a report and then instantly get a draft presentation of that report’s findings – a task that used to require manual effort. Additionally, Copilot can **summarize and condense PowerPoint decks**. With a click, it can produce a summary slide or an executive summary out of a lengthy presentation ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=stunning%20presentations,5)). This is **currently available**, facilitating iterative editing by allowing users to collapse dense information into digestible highlights. The inverse is true as well: Copilot can expand bullet points or an outline into full text. For example, in OneNote or Word, if you have a rough outline, Copilot can generate paragraphs for each bullet, fleshing out the content (OneNote’s Copilot explicitly offers to “generate content for you” from notes or topics ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20OneNote%20Copilot%20in%20OneNote,Your%20single))). This content expansion ability is **available** now to help move from outline to draft seamlessly. Another dimension of formatting flexibility is Copilot’s support for different document styles and templates. While one can always instruct Copilot via prompt to format output in a certain way (like “write this as a press release” or “use APA style citations”), Microsoft is making this more straightforward. The forthcoming personalization settings will let users define their preferred **formatting and style defaults** ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20bringing%20more%20personalization%20to,and%20voice%20when%20drafting%20emails)), so that Copilot automatically generates content in, say, a corporate memo format or with specific headings. This is **planned** and not fully here yet, though even currently a savvy user can guide Copilot with explicit instructions to achieve a required format. Copilot’s flexibility also extends to **SharePoint and web content** creation. Microsoft has announced **Copilot in SharePoint** for 2024, which will allow users to generate entire SharePoint pages and sites by describing their needs ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=they%20choose,all%20without%20having%20to)). It will use existing documents as data sources to build the site’s text and can even auto-rewrite draft content on the site for consistency or engagement ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=they%20choose,all%20without%20having%20to)). This capability is **planned (coming in CY2025)** and is not yet in the current Copilot, but it underscores that even web content generation and **content re-writing at scale** (for intranet pages) will be within Copilot’s reach. In the meanwhile, **Copilot in Loop** (which is **available in preview now** ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20Loop%20Copilot%20in,Yes%20Coming%20Q1CY25)) for worldwide tenants) showcases collaborative content creation: teams can co-create tables, lists, and pages with Copilot’s help. For example, they can ask Copilot to generate a project plan table in a Loop page, and everyone can see and refine it together ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20Loop%20Copilot%20in,Yes%20Coming%20Q1CY25)). This highlights formatting flexibility in a real-time, multi-user context. Another creative aspect of report generation is the inclusion of **visual content**. Microsoft 365 Copilot, through its integration with generative models, has also started to incorporate **image creation capabilities**. In the Penn State deployment (which uses Microsoft’s service with Enterprise Data Protection), one of the key features listed is “Creative Image Capabilities – Generate visuals using AI” ([Microsoft Copilot | Information Technology](https://www.it.psu.edu/services/office365/microsoft-copilot/#:~:text=,brainstorm%20ideas%2C%20and%20refine%20writing)), implying that users can ask Copilot to create images (likely via DALL‑E 3) to embed in their documents or presentations. Microsoft’s own materials have hinted at this as well – for instance, the “new design system” announcement (the next wave of Copilot) includes design and image generation features. While the exact rollout is recent, it appears that **image generation is becoming available** (or in preview) within Copilot chat experiences, allowing users to get AI-created graphics to accompany their reports. This is an evolving capability, so one might classify it as **currently emerging** (available in some contexts like Bing Image Creator in Copilot Chat, but not uniformly across all apps yet). In terms of output formats, Copilot is quite flexible: it can produce bullet lists, emails, documents, spreadsheets, meeting agendas, or action item lists as requested by the user. This flexibility is inherent and **available** – it simply follows the prompt. For instance, if you ask Copilot, “Summarize this report as a bulleted list of the top five findings,” it will do so. If you then say, “Now draft an email to the team with those findings,” it will switch format and tone accordingly. This dynamic formatting and context-aware content generation is part of the iterative process Copilot supports, and it’s in use today.

Regarding **user interface, usability, and collaboration features**, Microsoft 365 Copilot is designed to be seamlessly embedded into the user’s workflow and to even enhance team collaboration. Many of these UI and collaboration features are **currently available**, especially with Copilot’s general availability for enterprise as of November 2023 ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=Updates%20to%20our%20Copilot%20product,up)) ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=Copilot%20for%20Microsoft%20365%20has,of%20people%20use%20every%20day)). Copilot appears as a chatbot-like assistant within apps like Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams – often via a sidebar or a prompt window – providing a consistent way to invoke it. The interface is streamlined and similar across different applications, which Microsoft intentionally implemented so users have a short learning curve ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Integrated%20into%20the%20apps%20millions,for%20prompts%2C%20refinements%20and%20commands)). For example, whether you’re in Outlook or in Teams, invoking Copilot uses the same “Ask Copilot” box and similar buttons to refine or regenerate outputs, which is fully in place now. On the collaboration front, one of the marquee features is **Copilot in Teams meetings**. In every Teams meeting, Copilot can serve as an intelligent assistant that helps everyone stay on track. Already, Copilot can **summarize discussion points in real-time, identify who said what, highlight areas of agreement or dissent, and even suggest action items** before the meeting ends ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Copilot%20lightens%20the%20load,in%20Power%20Platform%2C%20anyone%20can)). This “live summary” capability was demonstrated and is **available in preview** to customers using Copilot in Teams now, making meetings more productive by offloading note-taking and tracking. Microsoft is taking this further: starting next year, Copilot will essentially have “a seat at the table” in meetings ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=,transcription%2C%20Copilot%20can%20answer%20questions)). New experiences (announced for early 2024) will allow Copilot to generate **collaborative meeting notes** that are shared with all participants automatically ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=,transcription%2C%20Copilot%20can%20answer%20questions)), and users can even give Copilot voice commands during the meeting – for instance, instructing it to **“quote” a specific person’s point** so it captures that verbatim in the notes ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=,transcription%2C%20Copilot%20can%20answer%20questions)). This turns Copilot into an active meeting participant. These advanced meeting features are **planned (not yet generally available)**; however, a related feature that is live is **Intelligent Recap**. Teams has an existing intelligent recap (summary of meeting recording) feature for Teams Premium, and Microsoft is integrating that with Copilot. Starting December 2023, users with Copilot can leverage intelligent recap even without a recording ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=you%20write%20a%20message%20or,meeting%20and%20get%20clear%20answers)): Copilot can provide the key points, decisions, and action items from meetings you missed, and crucially, you can **ask Copilot follow-up questions about the meeting** to get clear answers ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=you%20write%20a%20message%20or,meeting%20and%20get%20clear%20answers)). This integration is **rolling out now**, effectively meaning Copilot can brief you on any meeting and act as a post-meeting Q&A assistant (a strong research aid for catching up on discussions). Also noteworthy is that Microsoft added an option for **Copilot in meetings without transcription** ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=,interactions%20will%20be%20retained%20afterward)) – if privacy or compliance requires that no transcript be saved, Copilot can still answer questions and assist live during the meeting, then forget the content afterward. This option is **available now** for customers to enable ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=you%20can%20even%20instruct%20Copilot,interactions%20will%20be%20retained%20afterward)), highlighting Microsoft’s attention to different collaboration needs. Beyond meetings, **Copilot in Teams channels and chats** greatly enhances day-to-day collaboration. Copilot was initially introduced for Teams chat (personal chats) and is **now extended to Teams channels**, which is **currently available** as per recent updates ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=,on%20the%20same%20page%20whether)). Users can invoke Copilot in a channel to, say, summarize a long conversation thread, pull out any commitments or tasks mentioned, or get a quick digest of what happened in their absence. This is extremely useful for teams collaborating asynchronously. Copilot can also draft or help compose messages in Teams: the **Copilot compose box** in Teams allows a user to type an idea and have Copilot refine it or directly ask Copilot to draft a message on a topic ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=,recap%20will%20be%20integrated%20into)). This is **available now**, bringing iterative writing assistance to the very places people communicate with colleagues. In Outlook, Copilot similarly assists collaboration by helping prepare for and follow-up on meetings. A new feature **coming in early 2024** is Copilot’s ability to **prep you for upcoming meetings by synthesizing related information** ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=match%20at%20L354%20,quickly%20and%20show%20up%20prepped)). For example, Copilot in Outlook will scan your meeting invites, relevant email threads, and documents linked to the meeting topic, and generate a briefing (summary) so you can walk in informed ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=match%20at%20L354%20,quickly%20and%20show%20up%20prepped)). This is a **planned feature** not yet in current builds, but it builds on Copilot’s existing summarization ability in a focused way. Additionally, Outlook is getting Copilot improvements to help with scheduling – an animated preview showed Copilot being able to **schedule meetings, suggest optimal times, draft agendas, and recommend materials to share** ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=match%20at%20L365%20Image%3A%20Animated,times%20when%20everyone%20is%20available)). These scheduling and planning assists are part of Outlook Copilot’s evolution, slated for release in the near future (early 2024 timeframe). For now, what’s already available includes email drafting and thread summarization. Copilot in Outlook can quickly **draft responses to emails or even entire emails given a brief directive**, which is a current capability many testers have used ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Unlock%20productivity,in%20Power%20Platform%2C%20anyone%20can)). It can also summarize lengthy email threads at a glance (available now, so a user can click and have a complex multi-email conversation distilled into a few bullet points). Another collaboration-centric Copilot integration is with **Microsoft Loop**, a platform for fluid co-authoring. **Copilot in Loop** (in preview) enables teams to **co-create content together with AI assistance** ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20in%20Loop%20Copilot%20in,Yes%20Coming%20Q1CY25)). For example, in a Loop workspace, any member can ask Copilot to generate a draft project plan or brainstorm list; everyone can see and edit the AI-generated content in real time. This collaborative use of Copilot is **now in testing** and expected to broaden the ways multiple people can interact with AI simultaneously on shared documents. Microsoft is also introducing **Agents in SharePoint**, which are essentially specialized copilots tied to specific sites or knowledge bases ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20usage%2C%20adoption%20and%20impact,Coming%20CY25%20Coming)). An agent can be created for a SharePoint site (say a project site or an HR policy site) and will answer user questions with content only from that scope. This turns content into a Q&A bot automatically. Agents in SharePoint are **planned for Q1 2025** ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20usage%2C%20adoption%20and%20impact,Coming%20CY25%20Coming)). Once live, it will allow teams to spin up mini research assistants for their projects or departments, and even share those agents in Teams chats for others to use ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Copilot%20usage%2C%20adoption%20and%20impact,Coming%20CY25%20Coming)). On the **usability** side, Microsoft has ensured **Copilot is easily accessible across different surfaces**. There is a dedicated **Microsoft 365 Copilot app** (available on Windows and also via browsers at Microsoft365.com) which serves as a central place to interact with Copilot across work content ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20Copilot%20Chat%20Copilot,required%20to%20use%20Copilot%20Chat)). This unified Copilot Chat entry point is **available now** (for example, enterprise users can go to copilot.microsoft.com and sign in to use Copilot Chat in a standalone web experience ([Microsoft Copilot | Information Technology](https://www.it.psu.edu/services/office365/microsoft-copilot/#:~:text=Get%20Started%20with%20Microsoft%20Copilot))). Moreover, Copilot Chat is integrated into the **Edge browser sidebar** and Bing when logged in with work credentials ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20Copilot%20Chat%20Copilot,required%20to%20use%20Copilot%20Chat)), meaning users can call on Copilot while browsing or working on the web, enhancing research workflows. The emphasis on a consistent UI and multi-surface availability is to make Copilot a natural part of the workflow – which it already largely is for those with access. One can start a query on the Copilot app on PC, continue in Teams on mobile, etc., given it’s the same backend. There are also **administrative and guidance features** to aid usability: the Prompt Gallery (as mentioned) helps users formulate effective requests, and Microsoft’s adoption guides encourage prompt engineering practices to get the best results. The interface also typically provides buttons for common follow-ups (like “Make shorter,” “Elaborate,” or “Try a different tone”), which are part of the Copilot UX to streamline iterative improvement. These are present and contribute to usability by reducing the need to type every refinement. In summary, the UI and collaboration capabilities of Copilot are robust and mostly **present now**, with further enhancements (like deeper meeting integration and new app-specific copilots such as for Planner) in the pipeline. For example, **Copilot in Planner** has been announced: users will be able to create new plans or tasks via natural language and query project status (“What’s the progress on Project Alpha’s milestones?”) in plain English ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=match%20at%20L505%20such%20as,experience%20for%20the%20workplace%2C%20will)). This capability is **planned** – it wasn’t part of the initial release but was revealed at Ignite 2023 as coming soon. Similarly, **Copilot in Viva Goals** is **already available**, assisting with goal setting and progress summaries for OKRs ([The Future of Goal-Setting with Viva Goals: Copilot, Customized ...](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-goals-blog/the-future-of-goal-setting-with-viva-goals/ba-p/3800587#:~:text=,in)) (users can ask it to draft OKR descriptions or summarize how they’re tracking, which helps in writing these typically time-consuming reports). Each of these integrations extends Copilot’s collaborative reach into more corners of the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, indicating Microsoft’s strategy to embed AI assistance in every workflow.

Lastly, we evaluate **non-functional aspects such as performance, security, and compliance**, as well as the underlying NLP sophistication that enables iterative writing. Microsoft 365 Copilot is built on what Microsoft calls an “enterprise-ready AI” Copilot System ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Microsoft%20is%20uniquely%20positioned%20to,to%20everyone%20through%20natural%20language)). It uses the latest **GPT-4** model from OpenAI (and possibly other LLMs for specialized tasks), combined with a powerful orchestration layer that grounds the model on user data and context before each response ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Copilot%20System,to%20everyone%20through%20natural%20language)). This architecture is **currently in place**, which is why Copilot can handle complex prompts that involve reasoning over internal documents – it’s not just vanilla ChatGPT, but an orchestrated system fetching relevant data (via the semantic index and Graph connectors) and then feeding it to GPT-4 with user prompt and context. The performance of Copilot in terms of speed and reliability has been a focus. Microsoft has **deployed Copilot at scale internally** (330,000 employees) and reports that users are completing tasks significantly faster – in one study, people were 29% faster on a set of tasks and could catch up on meetings almost 4x faster with Copilot’s help ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=New%20Work%20Trend%20Index%20data,age%20of%20copilots%20is%20here)). This indicates that, in practice, Copilot performs quickly enough to save substantial time, and its responses are generated in a timeframe that makes it a net productivity gain. From a system performance perspective, Copilot’s responses usually come back in seconds for typical prompts, thanks to Azure’s optimized AI infrastructure. There are some usage limits in place to ensure system responsiveness – for example, one university noted sessions of up to 30 prompts and up to 300 total prompts per day as current limits to prevent overload ([Microsoft Copilot | Information Technology](https://www.it.psu.edu/services/office365/microsoft-copilot/#:~:text=Enterprise%20Data%20Protection%20is%20active)), and Microsoft 365 Personal users have 60 “credits” (essentially AI requests) per month under the free tier ([Frequently asked questions about Copilot in Microsoft 365 Personal ...](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/frequently-asked-questions-about-copilot-in-microsoft-365-personal-and-family-subscriptions-bda0d6e8-346d-41ce-ab1e-f6af6229c462#:~:text=Frequently%20asked%20questions%20about%20Copilot,extensive%20access%20to%20AI)). These limits reflect capacity management rather than technical inability, and for enterprise users (with the paid Copilot license) the limits are generally high enough that they won’t hinder normal use. As such, **performance is sufficient for everyday use** now, and Microsoft continues to optimize (the new Teams client, for instance, is tuned to better accommodate Copilot with less lag, improving the overall user experience). On the **security and privacy** front, Copilot was designed with enterprise compliance in mind from day one. All Copilot interactions automatically **inherit the organization’s security, compliance, and privacy policies** ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Built%20on%20Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20comprehensive%20approach,AI%20solution%20you%20can%20trust)) ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Copilot%20is%20integrated%20into%20Microsoft,AI%20solution%20you%20can%20trust)). This means features like two-factor authentication, data loss prevention (DLP) policies, eDiscovery, retention labels, etc., apply to Copilot outputs and interactions just as they would to any Office document or email. This is **currently in effect**. Importantly, Microsoft has emphasized that **Copilot does not use customer data to train the foundational AI models** ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Architected%20to%20protect%20tenant%2C%20group,same%20technology%20that%20we%E2%80%99ve%20been)). The user’s prompts and content stay within the tenant boundary and are transiently used to generate the response, then discarded. Microsoft and OpenAI have no eyes-on access to this data, and it’s not fed back into the AI model’s learning – a statement they reiterated when comparing Copilot Chat vs. free Bing Chat ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=become%20Copilot,used%20to%20train%20the%20models)) ([Introducing Microsoft Copilot Studio and new features in Copilot for Microsoft 365   | Microsoft 365 Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/11/15/introducing-microsoft-copilot-studio-and-new-features-in-copilot-for-microsoft-365/#:~:text=policies%E2%80%94so%20you%20know%20it%E2%80%99s%20enterprise,of%20people%20use%20every%20day)). This addresses a major privacy concern and is a **guarantee currently provided**. Additionally, Copilot’s design ensures **no data leakage between users** – if you ask something, Copilot will only draw on data you personally have permission to access ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Architected%20to%20protect%20tenant%2C%20group,years%20to%20secure%20customer%20data)). Tests have shown that even though the model is powerful, the system-level checks effectively prevent it from revealing, say, another colleague’s private document that you aren’t authorized to see. This permission fidelity is a current capability, stemming from Microsoft’s “time-tested permission model” baked into Graph ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Architected%20to%20protect%20tenant%2C%20group,years%20to%20secure%20customer%20data)). In terms of compliance, Microsoft is expanding integration with compliance tools: **Microsoft Purview** integration for Copilot is **planned for Q1 2025** ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=deep%20retrieval%20of%20content%20in,documents%20into%20scoped%20agents%20for)), which will extend compliance auditing and risk detection to Copilot’s activities. This likely means organizations will be able to retain logs of Copilot prompts and responses, check them for sensitive information disclosures, or apply retention policies to AI-generated content. Right now, Copilot logs are somewhat opaque to administrators, but with the planned Purview extension, Copilot will become more transparent and governable. Microsoft is also preparing **Copilot readiness and usage reports** (coming in 2025) for admins ([Microsoft 365 Copilot - Service Descriptions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20Copilot%20Readiness%20Report,Yes%20Coming%20CY25)), which will help organizations track adoption, usage patterns, and perhaps ensure it’s used in line with compliance needs. These are **planned** capabilities to support the non-functional requirement of governance. On the user side of non-functional expectations, one might consider reliability and accuracy. Copilot does not guarantee factual correctness (no AI does, yet), but Microsoft has incorporated features to mitigate errors. For instance, when using web grounding, Copilot **provides citations** so the user can verify facts ([Microsoft Copilot | Information Technology](https://www.it.psu.edu/services/office365/microsoft-copilot/#:~:text=%23%20Up)). It also sometimes points out its own limitations or suggests checking the source content, aligning with Microsoft’s responsible AI approach ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Committed%20to%20building%20responsibly)). Under the hood, Microsoft has filters to **prevent harmful or sensitive content**. The Copilot system uses prompt filtering and result filtering to block inappropriate requests or outputs (for example, it won’t produce disallowed content and will politely refuse if asked) ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Committed%20to%20building%20responsibly)). It also uses tools like InterpretML and Fairlearn to detect biases in responses ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Committed%20to%20building%20responsibly)). These responsible AI measures are **currently implemented**, as part of making Copilot enterprise-ready. So while Copilot can sometimes get things wrong (e.g., mis-identify a detail in a summary or make a poor suggestion), Microsoft encourages users to treat it as a draft partner and always review the AI-generated content ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=research%20on%20AI%2C%20grounding%20and,matter%20expertise)) ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=AI%20systems%20for%20potential%20harms,matter%20expertise)). The iterative nature of Copilot’s writing assistance actually helps address inaccuracies: a user can quickly ask Copilot to clarify or correct something that looks off, and because Copilot can cite and explain, the human remains in control of the final output. Finally, on the **iterative writing and NLP advancements** front, it’s worth noting how Copilot leverages cutting-edge AI to refine context with each interaction. The use of GPT-4 gives Copilot a highly nuanced understanding of language and context, enabling it to maintain continuity over a session and handle complex instructions. This means a user writing a report can engage in a back-and-forth with Copilot: _e.g._ “Draft an introduction about climate change impacts.” (Copilot produces a paragraph.) “Now include a statistic about sea level rise.” (Copilot adds it, understanding the context.) “Rewrite it to be more optimistic in tone.” (Copilot changes the phrasing accordingly.) Such iterative refinement of content is **fully available now** and is one of Copilot’s most lauded abilities ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Unleash%20creativity,can%20analyze%20trends%20and%20create)) ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=time,looking%20data%20visualizations%20in%20seconds)) – it dramatically reduces the friction of editing. The model’s large context window (thousands of tokens) allows Copilot to consider quite lengthy inputs – users have successfully fed entire documents for summarization or asked Copilot to take into account multiple pieces of content. Microsoft hasn’t published the exact max document size it can handle, but anecdotal usage shows it can process dozens of pages, which is in line with GPT-4’s capabilities. This is important for iterative writing on large research papers or extensive reports. Additionally, Microsoft continues to enhance the model’s “skill” repertoire. As noted in the introduction, Copilot is designed to **learn new skills** over time ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=Designed%20to%20learn%20new%20skills,be%20able%20to%20perform%20even)). For instance, integration with Viva Sales taught it how to pull CRM data into communications ([Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work - The Official Microsoft Blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/#:~:text=slide%E2%80%9D,more%20sophisticated%20tasks%20and%20queries)). This architecture means Microsoft can plug in new domain models or tools, and Copilot will expand its functionality. This is partly why Copilot is sometimes described as “only the beginning” – many iterative improvements, both in AI quality and feature breadth, are anticipated. Some **speculative future capabilities** might include even more proactive assistance (like Copilot suggesting to start a draft when it sees you’ve opened a new document, or offering research info unprompted), or voice interaction (speaking to Copilot during meetings or through Cortana-like scenarios – voice input isn’t explicitly in Copilot yet, but given Teams supports live transcripts and Windows has voice, one could envision this later). These are not confirmed features, so they remain **speculative** at this stage. What is certain is Microsoft’s commitment to continuous improvement: as users provide feedback and as AI research advances, Copilot’s underlying models will be updated (likely moving to newer GPT versions, etc.) and its alignment with user needs will get tighter.
