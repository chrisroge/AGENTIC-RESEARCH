Understood. I will research commercially available (COTS) solutions that provide deep research capabilities and an AI co-pilot for in-line text editing, with a focus on solutions that are already FedRAMP High authorized or are on the path to authorization. The research will also identify solutions with the ability to query private external data sources like Gartner, integrate real-time co-editing features, and potentially support advanced agentic capabilities such as executing workflows or interacting autonomously on behalf of users.

I'll get back to you with a detailed analysis of available solutions.

# Comparative Analysis of AI Co-Pilot Solutions for Deep Research

This analysis compares commercially available AI "co-pilot" solutions that combine deep research capabilities with in-line text editing and collaboration. Each solution is evaluated against key criteria: **FedRAMP compliance**, **real-time collaborative editing**, **data integration (internal, third-party, and web)**, and **agentic capabilities** (the ability to not only synthesize information but also perform actions). Security, data isolation, and compliance considerations are highlighted for each.

## Microsoft 365 Copilot (Microsoft)

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: Microsoft’s AI co-pilot for Office (Word, Excel, Teams, etc.) is on track for government use. The Azure OpenAI Service (which underpins Copilot) achieved **FedRAMP High** authorization in Azure Government in 2024 ([Azure OpenAI FedRAMP High + Microsoft 365 Copilot Targeting GA for GCC High and DOD by September 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft365copilot/azure-openai-fedramp-high--m365-copilot-targeting-sept-2025-for-gcc-highdod/4223788#:~:text=1,within%20their%20Azure%20Government%20environment)). Microsoft 365 Copilot is targeting general availability in **GCC High and DoD** (government cloud) by Summer 2025, pending U.S. government authorization ([Azure OpenAI FedRAMP High + Microsoft 365 Copilot Targeting GA for GCC High and DOD by September 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft365copilot/azure-openai-fedramp-high--m365-copilot-targeting-sept-2025-for-gcc-highdod/4223788#:~:text=2,our%20defense%20and%20government%20customers)). All prompts, content, and responses stay within the Microsoft 365 cloud boundary and **are not used to train the underlying models** ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=Important)). Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and Copilot only accesses data the user has permission to view (honoring SharePoint/Teams permissions) ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20Copilot%20only%20surfaces,shared%20channels%20in%20Microsoft%20Teams)). 

- **Collaboration & In-Line Editing**: Copilot integrates directly into Office 365 apps to provide **real-time co-editing assistance**. For example, in Word or Teams, a user can draft a document or message while Copilot suggests edits, generates text, or summarizes content on the fly. Multiple team members can collaborate on a document with Copilot’s input appearing as suggestions or generated sections, similar to a Google Docs experience. This is designed to **improve team productivity and collaboration**, with Copilot able to facilitate communication and project management in a shared environment ([Azure OpenAI Service is FedRAMP High and Copilot for Microsoft 365 GCC High and DOD GA update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/publicsectorblog/azure-openai-service-is-fedramp-high-and-copilot-for-microsoft-365-gcc-high-and-/4222955#:~:text=Enhanced%20Decision%20Making%2C%20where%20Copilot,agencies%20make%20more%20informed%20decisions)). (For instance, Copilot can summarize a Teams discussion or update an action item in a shared plan.)

- **Data Integration & Research Capabilities**: Microsoft 365 Copilot can pull information from across the user’s **internal data in Microsoft Graph** – emails, SharePoint documents, calendar entries, meeting transcripts, chats, and more – to ground its responses ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20Copilot%20provides%20value,accurate%2C%20relevant%2C%20and%20contextual%20responses)). This enables deep research on internal, FedRAMP-compliant datasets (e.g. it can find relevant data from an agency’s SharePoint or OneDrive). Copilot also supports **third-party and public data via plugins**. For example, with the Bing Search plugin enabled, it can safely retrieve relevant info from the web; it parses the user’s query, performs a Bing web search, and then incorporates the results into its answer ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=,Copilot%20and%20Microsoft%20365%20Copilot)). Microsoft is extending Copilot with connectors to services like Jira, ServiceNow, and others (through the Microsoft 365 plugin ecosystem), which would allow querying private third-party sources in-line. All web and third-party queries are done in a compliant manner (the Copilot service itself opts out of using these queries or any customer data to train the foundation AI model ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=Important))).

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Beyond research and writing assistance, Microsoft 365 Copilot can perform **automated actions and workflows** in context. In Outlook, it can draft emails or even send them on command; in Teams, it can schedule meetings or assign tasks via Microsoft Planner. Copilot is being positioned to help with **decision support and task automation** – for example, analyzing a large dataset in Excel and producing a summary, or generating a first draft of a report and then emailing it to stakeholders ([Azure OpenAI Service is FedRAMP High and Copilot for Microsoft 365 GCC High and DOD GA update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/publicsectorblog/azure-openai-service-is-fedramp-high-and-copilot-for-microsoft-365-gcc-high-and-/4222955#:~:text=Enhanced%20Decision%20Making%2C%20where%20Copilot,agencies%20make%20more%20informed%20decisions)). Future versions (especially in the government cloud) are expected to include **intelligent task management** where Copilot automates routine tasks to streamline operations ([Azure OpenAI Service is FedRAMP High and Copilot for Microsoft 365 GCC High and DOD GA update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/publicsectorblog/azure-openai-service-is-fedramp-high-and-copilot-for-microsoft-365-gcc-high-and-/4222955#:~:text=Enhanced%20Decision%20Making%2C%20where%20Copilot,agencies%20make%20more%20informed%20decisions)). All these actions happen with user oversight (the user reviews email drafts, confirms scheduling, etc.), but they demonstrate agentic assistance. Microsoft’s documentation notes that Copilot will deliver AI tools for **decision-making, automation, and enhanced collaboration** while meeting strict compliance needs in government settings ([Azure OpenAI FedRAMP High + Microsoft 365 Copilot Targeting GA for GCC High and DOD by September 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft365copilot/azure-openai-fedramp-high--m365-copilot-targeting-sept-2025-for-gcc-highdod/4223788#:~:text=September%202025%20for%20Microsoft%20365,of%20our%20defense%20and%20government)) ([Azure OpenAI FedRAMP High + Microsoft 365 Copilot Targeting GA for GCC High and DOD by September 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft365copilot/azure-openai-fedramp-high--m365-copilot-targeting-sept-2025-for-gcc-highdod/4223788#:~:text=2,our%20defense%20and%20government%20customers)).

## Google Workspace “Duet AI” (Google)

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: Google Workspace (the suite including Docs, Sheets, Gmail, etc.) achieved **FedRAMP High authorization** in 2021, meaning it can handle federal data up to High impact level ([Government Program Solutions for Collaboration - Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/industries/government/#:~:text=Workspace%20workspace,help%20you%20transition%20to)). Google’s generative AI for Workspace, known as **Duet AI** (powered by models including Google’s Gemini), is in the process of FedRAMP approval. In late 2024 Google submitted Gemini for FedRAMP High authorization to extend these AI features to federal customers ([
Google Workspace Updates: FedRAMP High authorization for Gemini for Workspace
](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-for-workspace-fedramp-high-authorization.html#:~:text=As%20recently%20announced%2C%20we%20submitted,cloud%20technologies%20for%20critical%20operations)). Until authorization is obtained, Duet AI features would only be available in restricted previews for government. From a data security perspective, Google emphasizes that **Workspace customer data is not used to train** the AI models ([Data privacy protections with Duet AI in Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/protecting-your-data-era-generative-ai#:~:text=Data%20privacy%20protections%20with%20Duet,and%20large%20language%20models)). All prompts and outputs stay within the organization’s Google Cloud boundary. Google also offers data location controls and has received IL4 (DoD Impact Level 4) provisional authorization, indicating strong security practices ([
Google Workspace Updates: FedRAMP High authorization for Gemini for Workspace
](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-for-workspace-fedramp-high-authorization.html#:~:text=As%20recently%20announced%2C%20we%20submitted,cloud%20technologies%20for%20critical%20operations)). 

- **Collaboration & In-Line Editing**: Duet AI is deeply embedded in Google’s real-time collaboration environment. In Google Docs, for instance, multiple users can co-edit a document while **Duet acts as an intelligent writing assistant**. A user can ask Duet to “help me write” on a topic, and it will generate content inline, which the team can then refine together. It can also **suggest edits and style improvements** as you type. This mirrors the familiar Google Docs experience (multiple cursors, suggestions) but augmented with AI. In Gmail, Duet can draft emails from brief instructions, and in Google Meet it can even take notes or **summarize meetings in real-time** for participants. The key is that the AI works in real time in the same collaborative space as the users – offering **autocomplete suggestions, summaries, and answers** in chat (Google Chat) or documents, without breaking the flow of teamwork.

- **Data Integration & Research Capabilities**: Out-of-the-box, Duet AI primarily leverages data within the Google Workspace domain for each user. This means it can pull in information from your emails, your Google Drive documents, your calendars, etc., to provide context-aware assistance. For example, in Gmail it can contextually summarize a long email thread or in Docs it might draw on a relevant file from Drive when asked a question. Google also provides an enterprise search feature (Cloud Search) that can index internal data and third-party sources; Duet AI can be expected to interface with such indexes to answer user queries with enterprise data. For instance, an agency could index its internal knowledge base (and even subscription data like Gartner reports if ingested into a Google Drive or Cloud Search), and Duet could retrieve from that. **Public web data** is not directly integrated into Google Workspace’s Duet by default (unlike Bing in Microsoft’s case). However, users can of course use Google’s core Search separately. Google has been careful with direct web integration in Workspace due to data governance, but it’s evolving. (Notably, Google’s Vertex AI Search, a separate product, can do retrieval-augmented QA from selected web sources, which could be a route to bring web data into Workspace in the future). In summary, Duet currently excels at helping draft and analyze content you provide, rather than acting as an open-web research agent – though it can certainly help summarize public info a user pastes in. Google’s focus is ensuring any integration with external data is done via approved connectors or APIs in a secure manner.

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Duet AI’s primary role is assistive (drafting, summarizing, answering), and it generally stops short of taking autonomous actions without user direction. It can generate emails or document content, but the user sends the email or finalizes the doc. That said, Duet is adding productivity features that blur the line into automation. For example, in Google Calendar, Duet can **schedule meetings for you** (if you prompt it with something like “find a meeting time with Alice next week”), effectively acting on your behalf within that app. In Google Meet, a feature called “Attend for me” allows Duet to join a meeting, deliver a brief message, and take notes – essentially automating an attendance task. These are early forms of agentic behavior under user control. Duet AI can also interface with Google AppSheet (a no-code tool) to create simple workflows or apps from natural language, demonstrating basic **workflow automation**. It does not yet have a multi-step autonomous agent that can, say, browse the web and perform multi-faceted tasks on its own (and any such capabilities would be gated by admin controls and compliance). The value-added actions Duet provides today are within Google’s own services (drafting replies, organizing content, summarizing and transcribing, etc.). As Google’s Gemini AI matures, we expect more agentic functions, but always with a human in the loop and aligned to compliance (e.g., an admin can disable any feature not permitted, and all actions are audit-logged). 

## Primer Delta and Command (Primer AI)

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: **Primer** offers an AI platform tailored for intelligence analysis and deep research, used in defense and government. Primer’s platform (often referred to as *Primer Delta*, with *Primer Command* for real-time OSINT) is on a path to high security accreditation. Through a partnership with Palantir, **Primer Delta is being delivered in a FedRAMP authorized IL5 environment** ([Primer announces FedRAMP security - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/news/primer-ai-announces-fedramp-security/#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO%2C%20CA%2C%20September%2011%2C,agencies%20through%20Palantir%E2%80%99s%20FedStart%20offering)). In 2023, Primer announced that its platform will carry a FedRAMP designation and DoD Impact Level 5 authorization via Palantir’s FedStart program ([Primer announces FedRAMP security - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/news/primer-ai-announces-fedramp-security/#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO%2C%20CA%2C%20September%2011%2C,agencies%20through%20Palantir%E2%80%99s%20FedStart%20offering)). (Palantir FedStart allows third-party products like Primer to run in Palantir’s already accredited cloud framework). Additionally, Primer has an Authority to Operate on JWICS (the high-security intelligence network) and meets IL5 requirements in that deployment ([Primer Delta - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-delta/#:~:text=%2A%20)) – underscoring its focus on strict government compliance. All data processed by Primer’s tools stays within the secure government cloud or on-premise environment of the client. Primer’s models and algorithms can even be deployed in classified environments, and they use a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Verification (RAG-V)** approach to minimize errors and hallucinations. Notably, Primer claims its validation tech catches over **99% of errors before they reach users**, ensuring outputs are **traceable to verified sources** ([Primer Delta - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-delta/#:~:text=%2A%20)). This is a critical security feature: analysts can trust but verify every AI-generated statement by checking its sources, which is essential for high-stakes government use.

- **Collaboration & Co-Editing**: Primer’s solutions are designed for **analysts and researchers to collaborate with AI** in producing intelligence reports and analyses. While Primer isn’t a word processor like Google Docs, it provides a workbench where users ask questions and get draft narratives that they can refine. Primer Delta’s interface allows an analyst to search and explore data, then **quickly compile findings into a report** ([Primer Delta - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-delta/#:~:text=Enable)). The AI can generate drafted sections of text (with citations) that the user can edit or approve. Multiple analysts can use Primer in parallel on their own investigations, and then share the AI-generated insights or reports through the platform. Primer supports exporting fully sourced reports which can be reviewed by a team. In essence, **the collaboration happens in how AI accelerates the research legwork**, allowing human analysts to focus on interpreting and editing the results. Team collaboration is further supported by the ability to distribute intelligence products: Primer makes it easy to share the AI’s output up the chain of command or with other departments ([Home - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/#:~:text=generate%20reports%20on%20rapidly%20evolving,at%20times%20of%20critical%20need)). For instance, one analyst could use Primer to generate a brief and another analyst or editor could simultaneously fact-check it (since sources are attached) and polish the language. This is more of a sequential collaboration than live co-editing of the exact same text, but it significantly speeds up multi-person workflows that produce analytic written products.

- **Data Integration & Deep Research**: The core strength of Primer’s platform is **aggregating and searching vast amounts of data** (both structured and unstructured) and returning synthesized insights. Primer Delta is essentially a semantic search and analysis engine that plugs into **your enterprise or agency data**. It can index millions of documents across various repositories – internal document databases, SharePoint, email archives, intelligence reports, etc. – and let users query in natural language. The AI will **scan “millions of documents” and deliver precise answers** to the query ([Primer Delta - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-delta/#:~:text=Search)), complete with references. This covers internal datasets (including classified data, when deployed in classified networks). Primer also integrates **external data sources**: for example, Primer Command (a complementary product) ingests roughly 5 million posts per day from social media, news, and blogs to monitor real-time events ([Command - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-command/#:~:text=Seize%20every%20advantage%20and%20empower,social%20media%20and%20news%20landscapes)) ([Command - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-command/#:~:text=Image)). Government users can include open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds – from live web data to subscription services like Janes, or industry research – into the platform. If an agency has licensed data (say from Gartner or Factiva), that can be ingested so that Primer will include those in its semantic search results. Additionally, via Palantir’s integration, Primer can access data that Palantir’s platform connects to (such as various databases and data lakes in government). In practice, an analyst can ask, “What do Gartner and Forrester say about Zero Trust security?” and if those reports are loaded internally, Primer will retrieve relevant sentences and provide a summary with citations. Or an intelligence officer could ask, “Summarize recent drone sightings in region X from our reports and news,” and Primer will pull from internal SIGACT reports as well as live news sources. **All results are source-attributed**, enabling deep trust in the research process. Primer’s approach of constant grounding in actual documents (rather than just model knowledge) is crucial for verifiable research in government use.

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Primer’s primary function is to **retrieve, analyze, and synthesize information**, rather than to perform operational tasks on behalf of users. It stops short of executing external actions like sending emails or triggering workflows (in contrast to some more workflow-oriented AI agents). However, within the analytic process, Primer does automate a lot of what would be manual labor. For example, it automatically generates digests of trends (saving analysts from reading thousands of documents), it can run ongoing monitoring (Primer Command can alert users to emerging narratives or changes in sentiment 24/7), and it helps compile reports quickly ([Home - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/#:~:text=generate%20reports%20on%20rapidly%20evolving,at%20times%20of%20critical%20need)). These are **“value-added” automations in the research workflow** – essentially automating the data collection, reading, and initial writing steps that a human would do, thus acting as a force-multiplier for analysts. Primer’s platform can also integrate with other tools (via APIs or Palantir’s mechanisms) to insert its insights into dashboards or send alerts. For instance, if Primer identifies a critical piece of intelligence, it could be configured to flag a human or populate a field in another system. But importantly, any final actions (like disseminating a report or making a decision) are left to human users. Primer does plan to continually shorten the “time to insight,” so we may see more agentic features like recommending next steps or auto-updating certain knowledge bases. Given the sensitive contexts it’s used in, Primer keeps a human in the loop for decisions. In summary, Primer is an **analytic co-pilot**: it autonomously handles data crunching and initial synthesis, and while it might not autonomously send an email, it dramatically automates the groundwork for informed decisions and allows users to act faster on the information.

## Palantir AIP (Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform)

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: **Palantir AIP** is an AI platform built on Palantir’s existing government-grade infrastructure. Palantir’s cloud offerings (Foundry, Gotham, and the new AIP included) have achieved **FedRAMP High baseline authorization as of Dec 2024** ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)). This means AIP can be used for **“the most sensitive unclassified workloads”** in U.S. government ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)), and Palantir also holds DoD IL5/6 for higher classification levels ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20accreditation%20extends%20across%20Palantir%E2%80%99s,Gotham%2C%20FedStart%20and%20Mission%20Manager)). Security is a hallmark of Palantir – data is strictly partitioned, access controls are extremely granular, and all actions are logged. AIP inherits these controls: an agency can deploy AIP so that it runs on a private network (including on classified networks) with **full control over which data the AI can access and what it can do** ([Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/aip/#:~:text=Palantir%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Platform%20Run,private%20network%20with%20full%20control)) ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=can%20be%20provided%20with%20an,Lets%20dive%20into%20these)). Palantir emphasizes guardrails: AIP is configured with “**guard-railed access**” to data and tools ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=can%20be%20provided%20with%20an,Lets%20dive%20into%20these)). Each AI agent in AIP is isolated to only see the data it’s supposed to (“views of the connected ontology” per configuration) ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Agent%20Isolation%20and%20Independence)), preventing any accidental data leak across departments. Furthermore, Palantir has built-in mechanisms for human feedback and override. No output leaves the environment unless approved by the organization. In short, AIP is built to **government security specs from the ground up**, leveraging Palantir’s longstanding role in defense and intel (which includes prior ATOs and robust compliance practices).

- **Collaboration & Co-Editing**: Palantir AIP is less about co-writing documents and more about **embedding AI into collaborative data workflows**. In a Palantir environment, often many users (analysts, operators) collaborate on a common dataset or mission, sharing insights through the platform’s dashboards and objects. AIP introduces a conversational interface and AI-driven actions into this mix. For example, multiple analysts could be examining supply chain data in Palantir Foundry and use AIP’s chat interface to query the data in natural language. The **AI can draft an analysis or recommend decisions** which the team can then review within the platform. If the team is writing a report in Palantir (Palantir has modules for documentations or “notebooks”), AIP can help populate that report. Palantir demonstrated a “chat with your data” style collaboration: a user asks a question, the AI retrieves info and even produces a draft directive, and another user can tweak the parameters or ask a follow-up. **Human-AI teaming** is central: Palantir often refers to “keeping a human in the loop”. They even provide a **“cockpit” for human operators** to supervise and intervene when the AI is unsure ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=In%20some%20cases%2C%20a%20human,%E2%80%98unsure%E2%80%99%20and%20requires%20human%20inputs)). This means while one operator converses with the AI agent, another can monitor suggestions and approve or correct them – a novel collaborative workflow between humans and AI. In mission contexts (like military planning), multiple staff officers might collaboratively prompt AIP to explore scenarios, with the AI producing outputs that they jointly edit and turn into orders or reports. So, the collaboration isn’t a Google-Docs style text co-edit per se, but rather **collaboration on decision-making and data interpretation with AI as an active participant**. All users share a common view of what the AI is suggesting, and they can accept or modify those suggestions in real-time.

- **Data Integration & Research Capabilities**: Palantir’s forte is data integration, and AIP fully capitalizes on that. AIP can tap into the entire **Palantir “ontology”** – which is basically a unified layer representing all of an organization’s data (databases, documents, sensor feeds, transaction logs, you name it). This means the AI can **draw from internal systems (ERP, CRM, HR, custom databases)** and cross-correlate information. For example, AIP could answer a query like “How many open investigations involve Person X and what contracts are they tied to?” by pulling from case management systems and contract databases in one go. In Palantir’s own demo, AIP was tied into systems like SAP and Salesforce ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Data%20Landscape)) – showing that it can combine operational data (orders, customer info) with other context. It can also bring in **external data** if available in the environment: e.g., if connected to an open-source intelligence feed or a web API, AIP can incorporate that. Many Palantir deployments ingest third-party data such as commercial satellite imagery, financial market data, or research reports, so AIP would make that queryable in natural language as well. Moreover, AIP allows semantic search similar to others: you can ask in plain English and get **“fluent and grounded” answers** (likely with sources, as Palantir has been working on explainable AI ([How Palantir AIP Improves LLM Explainability](https://blog.palantir.com/thinking-outside-the-black-box-24d0c87ec8a5#:~:text=How%20Palantir%20AIP%20Improves%20LLM,AI%20systems%20within%20Palantir%20AIP))). Because Palantir now has FedRAMP High, even data from law enforcement or health records (Privacy Act, HIPAA data) could theoretically be integrated safely for AI analysis, with all compliance controls in place. In summary, AIP’s AI does “deep research” across any data you give Palantir – internal, proprietary third-party, or curated open data – and it does so with the context of Palantir’s strong data lineage (so you can always trace where info came from). This makes it extremely powerful for government users who often need to correlate across silos.

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Palantir AIP is explicitly designed to **turn conversations into actions**. Unlike a read-only chatbot, it can carry out operations in connected systems with the proper permissions. Palantir introduced the concept of **“Actions”** in AIP: these are custom-defined operations the AI can execute, such as updating a database record, calling an external API, or even running a piece of code ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Our%20agents%20need%20to%20be,execution%20using%20Function%20on%20Objects)). For example, if an analyst says, “Approve all low-risk cases and notify the applicants,” AIP (if configured to do so) could execute an action that marks those cases as approved in the system and sends template emails – all autonomously or with one-click confirmation. In one scenario Palantir described, an AI agent can autonomously handle a customer service request: classify the request, look up order details in SAP, run a machine learning model to get an estimated delivery date, then draft an email response to the customer and even execute an order update if needed ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=,response%20based%20on%20the%20suggested)) ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Our%20agents%20need%20to%20be,execution%20using%20Function%20on%20Objects)). All of that is done by chaining various Actions that AIP is allowed to use. **External interactions** are possible too: AIP could call an external web service or trigger a workflow in another application as an action ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Our%20agents%20need%20to%20be,execution%20using%20Function%20on%20Objects)). Essentially, Palantir AIP enables an **autonomous agent** within the bounds you set – it can be as agentic as you trust it to be. Many government uses will keep a human decision-maker in the loop (for example, AIP may prepare a set of actions but wait for a human to approve execution). But the platform supports full automation if policies permit. This includes things like: automatically reallocating resources when an AI detects a logistic issue, or flagging inconsistencies and correcting data entries across systems. Because Palantir integrates with operational systems (and not just knowledge stores), **the AI can have real-world impact** (e.g., adjusting a satellite’s tasking schedule or re-routing a supply convoy in software). Robust safeguards (like requiring human sign-off or providing explanations for each action) are part of the design to maintain control. In summary, Palantir AIP goes beyond information synthesis: it’s an “autonomous operations” co-pilot. It primarily retrieves and summarizes data to inform decisions, but it *also* can carry out those decisions or other tedious tasks, effectively functioning as a junior analyst or assistant that not only writes recommendations but can implement them under supervision ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Our%20agents%20need%20to%20be,execution%20using%20Function%20on%20Objects)).

## Moveworks AI Platform

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: **Moveworks** provides an AI assistant platform, historically focused on enterprise IT and HR support, now extending to government use. As of early 2025, Moveworks has achieved **FedRAMP Ready** status for its dedicated GovCloud environment ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20we%20take%20immense,FedRAMP%20process%20and%20its%20requirements)). This indicates a 3PAO (third-party assessor) has vetted their readiness for FedRAMP, and Moveworks is actively pursuing full authorization. In fact, Moveworks is targeting a **FedRAMP Moderate authorization** for its platform in AWS GovCloud ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Key%20aspects%2C%20such%20as%20heightened,data%20protection%20and%20security%20compliance)), which would allow use with sensitive but unclassified data across federal agencies. (FedRAMP Moderate covers a wide range of government data; High might be pursued later if needed for things like law enforcement data.) Moveworks GovCloud is hosted in a U.S. Gov AWS region (us-gov-east-1) in a **segregated environment to ensure data isolation** ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Working%20with%20Moveworks%20GovCloud)). Government customer data is kept separate from commercial data, and all the security controls (encryption, auditing, access control) are in place to meet FedRAMP requirements. Moveworks also emphasizes “top-tier security” including SSO, encryption, and compliance alignment by design ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=1.%20Top,commitment%20to%20security%20and%20privacy)). Like others, Moveworks does not use customer-specific data to train its base AI models; each customer’s data is only used to serve that customer (this is essential for privacy given it often ingests internal knowledge base content). Achieving FedRAMP Ready and moving to authorized status shows Moveworks’ commitment to meeting government cloud security standards.

- **Collaboration & In-Line Experience**: Moveworks offers an AI **digital assistant** that typically lives in chat interfaces like **Microsoft Teams or Slack** for real-time interaction ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=5,including%20Microsoft%20Teams%20or%20Slack)). While this is a different modality than document co-editing, it still enables a form of in-line collaboration: users can ask the Moveworks bot questions or even have it draft messages/documents, right within the conversation. For example, an employee could be in a Teams channel and query the Moveworks AI for information (“What’s the procedure for onboarding a contractor?”) and the AI will instantly provide an answer or even a snippet of a document. That answer can be edited by the user or shared with colleagues. Multiple users can be in the same channel and see the AI’s response, effectively **collaborating with the AI as a team**. Moveworks also introduced features like “Brief Me” (an AI summarizer) which can summarize lengthy content for a user in a chat, and “QuickGPT” for ad-hoc queries ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=,Quick%20GPT%20New)). In terms of co-editing text, a user could ask Moveworks to draft a piece of text (say a reply to an IT ticket or an email to a customer), and then refine it themselves – similar to how one would use an AI writing assistant. The key collaborative aspect is that Moveworks brings AI help into the *same tools where people are already collaborating*. In an organization, instead of going to a separate app to chat with AI, you add the Moveworks bot to your project channel or open it in your chat sidebar, and then **both you and your colleagues can leverage it in context**. This makes the AI a participant in the conversation, which is a powerful paradigm for collaboration (for instance, the AI can dynamically fetch data or answers while humans focus on strategy). While Moveworks may not offer a multi-user document editor, it enables real-time co-creation of knowledge in chat, which many find just as valuable during day-to-day work.

- **Data Integration & Research**: Moveworks connects to a **wide array of enterprise data sources** to answer questions and fulfill requests. It has an extensive **plugin and integration library** ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=helping%20enable%20a%20quick%20return,on%20your%20investment)) – out-of-the-box connectors for platforms like ServiceNow (ITSM data), Salesforce, Workday (HR data), Confluence or SharePoint (knowledge bases), etc. For an agency, Moveworks could index internal policy documents, FAQs, wikis, as well as connect to systems (e.g., an asset management database or a case tracking system). It uses semantic NLP search to retrieve relevant information from these sources when a user asks a question. For third-party private data, if an agency has licensed content (like Gartner research), an administrator could load those documents into a knowledge base that Moveworks indexes, and the AI would then be able to answer queries based on that content. Similarly, Moveworks can tap into public web data **if explicitly integrated** – for example, if connected to a company’s public website or a curated internet knowledge source. By default, it focuses on the organization’s internal data (to avoid any compliance issues with pulling arbitrary web content), but it’s capable of calling external APIs. In fact, Moveworks’ plugin architecture could allow an integration with a web search API or a specific external database if a use-case demanded it. The platform also supports multi-turn conversations, meaning if the initial answer isn’t sufficient, the user can ask follow-ups and Moveworks will use context to refine its retrieval. In summary, Moveworks acts as a unified **semantic search and action engine** across all enterprise knowledge sources – from the employee handbook to the latest vendor records – presenting the result conversationally. It **understands natural language queries** and returns answers or performs lookups across these connected systems to save the user from manually searching each database ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=2,of%20government%20or%20enterprise%20data)) ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=5,including%20Microsoft%20Teams%20or%20Slack)).

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Moveworks is built not just to fetch information, but also to **take actions to resolve user requests automatically**. This is one of its standout features, especially in IT support scenarios. For instance, if a user says “I can’t access VPN,” Moveworks can proactively create a help desk ticket in ServiceNow, or even attempt to auto-resolve the issue by triggering a workflow (like resetting the VPN account). The platform comes with many **pre-trained “skills” or agents** for common tasks – resetting passwords, provisioning software, answering HR questions, etc. – and can integrate with enterprise workflows to execute those tasks. Moveworks describes this as enabling organizations to **“use and build AI agents”** that handle end-to-end processes ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Microsoft%20Teams%20or%20Slack)). Through its **Creator Studio**, developers at an agency can define custom workflows that Moveworks will carry out. For example, an HR team could create an agent that, when asked “Enroll me in the 401k plan,” will navigate the internal HR system and initiate that enrollment. These actions are performed autonomously by the AI agent (after appropriate authentication), not just suggested. Moveworks’ **agentic AI** extends to sending communications: it can dispatch emails or Teams messages for notifications (“Your VPN access has been restored” to the user, for example). It basically serves as a 24/7 virtual assistant that can transact on behalf of users for routine needs. Importantly, guardrails are in place – it only performs actions it’s been explicitly configured and permitted to do, and sensitive operations can require confirmation. In a federal context, this could translate to automating workflows like onboarding a user to a system (with proper approvals), or gathering data from multiple systems into a report. While Moveworks is mostly oriented toward IT/service desk use cases, those agentic capabilities can be applied more broadly (any repetitive multi-step process could potentially be handled by a Moveworks bot). As Moveworks evolves in the government space, we might see domain-specific agents (for finance, procurement, etc.). But even out-of-the-box, it brings a strong toolkit of **autonomous workflow fulfillment** that goes beyond Q&A. This can significantly reduce the manual workload on staff by handling the “last mile” of a query – not just giving an answer, but completing the task.

## Additional Noteworthy Solutions and Considerations

In addition to the above specific products, it’s worth mentioning the broader ecosystem and emerging solutions:

- **AWS Generative AI Stack (Amazon Bedrock & Kendra)**: Amazon Web Services provides building blocks rather than a single end-user co-pilot, but these are important COTS components agencies can leverage. **Amazon Kendra**, an intelligent semantic search service, is FedRAMP Moderate and even **FedRAMP High authorized** in certain regions ([Amazon Kendra is now FedRAMP High Compliant - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-kendra-fedramp-high-compliant/#:~:text=Amazon%20Kendra%20is%20now%20authorized,search%20service%20powered%20by)). It allows organizations to index internal documents and websites and ask natural language questions, much like an AI research assistant. Kendra can be paired with AWS’s new **Amazon Bedrock** service, which provides access to foundation models (like Amazon’s Titan, Anthropic’s Claude, etc.) in a fully managed, secure way. Notably, Amazon Bedrock itself achieved **FedRAMP High authorization in GovCloud** in 2024 ([Amazon Bedrock achieves FedRAMP High authorization - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-bedrock-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization#:~:text=Posted%20on%3A%20Aug%201%2C%202024)). Using these, a government agency could construct its own in-line editing co-pilot – for example, integrating a Q&A chatbot into a custom knowledge portal or even into Microsoft Word via an add-in. AWS has published guides on building a FedRAMP-compliant generative chatbot using Bedrock ([Build a FedRAMP compliant generative AI-powered chatbot using ...](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/build-a-fedramp-compliant-generative-ai-powered-chatbot-using-amazon-aurora-machine-learning-and-amazon-bedrock/#:~:text=Build%20a%20FedRAMP%20compliant%20generative,of%20which%20are%20FedRAMP%20compliant)). The difference is that AWS’s solution here is not out-of-the-box UI; it requires development effort to integrate. But it offers maximum flexibility: one could connect to internal data, private data (via Kendra connectors), and do live web queries (via APIs) while staying within a FedRAMP High environment. And with Bedrock’s support for creating “agents” that can execute AWS Lambda functions, there is potential for agentic behavior (like updating a database when prompted) ([Amazon Bedrock achieves FedRAMP High authorization - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-bedrock-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization#:~:text=performing%20foundation%20models%20,your%20applications%20using%20other%20AWS)) ([Amazon Bedrock achieves FedRAMP High authorization - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-bedrock-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization#:~:text=customize%20them%20with%20your%20data,you%20can%20securely%20integrate%20and)). In short, AWS’s COTS services enable a **DIY co-pilot** that can meet strict compliance – indeed some vendors like Moveworks build on AWS – though agencies must assemble the pieces to create a seamless user experience.

- **OpenAI and Others**: OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise, while very popular in commercial settings, does not yet have FedRAMP authorization in a government cloud. However, OpenAI’s models are accessible in the Azure Government (via Azure OpenAI) and AWS GovCloud (via Bedrock) as noted. There are also specialized startups focusing on secure, domain-specific co-pilots – for example, **Primer (covered above)** is one, and others include **HyperScience** (document-processing AI that got FedRAMP High via Palantir FedStart ([Hyperscience Achieves FedRamp High Accreditation with Palantir](https://www.hyperscience.com/newsroom/hyperscience-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization-through-strategic-partnership-with-palantir/#:~:text=Hyperscience%20Achieves%20FedRamp%20High%20Accreditation,performance%2C%20security%2C%20and%20compliance%20standards))), and **Manifest** (SBOM analysis AI, also piggybacking on Palantir’s High authorization) – these indicate a trend: new AI services leveraging existing FedRAMP-authorized platforms to accelerate compliance ([Manifest Achieves FedRAMP® High Authorization Through Palantir ...](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/manifest-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization-through-palantir-technologies-302343468.html#:~:text=Manifest%20Achieves%20FedRAMP%C2%AE%20High%20Authorization,authorized%20environment)) ([Hyperscience Achieves FedRamp High Accreditation with Palantir](https://www.hyperscience.com/newsroom/hyperscience-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization-through-strategic-partnership-with-palantir/#:~:text=Hyperscience%20Achieves%20FedRamp%20High%20Accreditation,performance%2C%20security%2C%20and%20compliance%20standards)). Another example is **IBM’s watsonx** suite; IBM has long provided AI tools to government (with on-prem deployments for compliance) and is likely moving toward FedRAMP for its cloud offerings. *IBM Watson Orchestrate* (an AI “digital worker” that can do tasks like scheduling and emailing) is an analog to some agentic co-pilots, and while not FedRAMPed as a SaaS yet, IBM’s cloud for government is FedRAMP Moderate and could host such a service. **Atlassian** is bringing AI (via Atlassian Intelligence) into Confluence and Jira for smarter collaboration; Atlassian’s government cloud is in process for FedRAMP Moderate ([We've achieved “In Process” status on the FedRAMP Marketplace!](https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Trust-Security-articles/We-ve-achieved-In-Process-status-on-the-FedRAMP-Marketplace/ba-p/2756436#:~:text=We%27ve%20achieved%20%E2%80%9CIn%20Process%E2%80%9D%20status,Cloud%20while%20safeguarding%20your)), so its AI features would follow accordingly. These examples show a landscape of emerging co-pilot solutions focusing on specific niches (DevOps, documentation, process automation) that are on the horizon for government use as they achieve the necessary compliance.

Essentially acts as an autonomous helpdesk agent for routine tasks. |

Each of these solutions provides a **blend of AI-driven research and productivity** while maintaining strong security postures required for government use. Microsoft and Google are bringing familiar productivity suites into the AI era with upcoming FedRAMP-authorized co-pilots, focusing on content creation and teamwork. Primer and Palantir offer mission-focused analytic platforms where the AI digs through data and supports high-stakes decisions with full traceability and compliance. Moveworks (and similar enterprise assistant platforms) show how AI can be a practical teammate in everyday workflows, automating drudgery securely within an organization’s IT stack.

When evaluating these solutions, agencies should consider trade-offs like **maturity vs. customization**. Microsoft and Google’s offerings will seamlessly enhance existing office workflows but are on the cusp of FedRAMP availability (timelines mid-2025) and may have constraints on connecting outside their ecosystems. Primer and Palantir are powerful for deep analysis, already proven in defense environments, but they are specialized (best for intelligence, operations, or data-rich scenarios). Moveworks demonstrates quick wins in employee-facing automation and knowledge delivery, though it might need expansion for broader research use cases. 

All solutions prioritize **data security and isolation**, ensuring no AI model is trained on agency data and that sensitive information doesn’t leak. FedRAMP (and related DoD SRG) compliance status is a key differentiator – it signals which solutions can be adopted now versus which are promising but pending approval.
