This approach allows administrators and developers to identify and address problems efficiently. Common error codes include `ContentError`, `DataLossPreventionViolation`, `FlowActionException`, and `SystemError`. Each code is accompanied by a description and recommended resolution steps, facilitating effective troubleshooting. citeturn0search0

Additionally, Copilot Studio emphasizes graceful error handling in conversational experiences. When misrecognition or execution errors occur, the system prompts users for clarification or provides options to rectify the issue, ensuring a seamless interaction flow. For instance, if the system misunderstands a user's input, it may ask the user to rephrase their request or offer specific alternatives to guide the conversation back on track. citeturn0search3

Furthermore, Microsoft has implemented data integrity checks and processes within Microsoft 365 production environments. Peer replication between datacenters ensures multiple live copies of data, enhancing resiliency against data corruption. For example, in Exchange Online, mailboxes are hosted in Database Availability Groups (DAGs) and replicated across geographically separate datacenters within the same region. This setup includes multiple copies of each mailbox database, with one active copy, two up-to-date copies, and one 7-day lagged copy used in rare cases of catastrophic logical corruption. citeturn0search7

These comprehensive error handling and data recovery mechanisms demonstrate Microsoft 365 Copilot's commitment to reliability and system integrity.
