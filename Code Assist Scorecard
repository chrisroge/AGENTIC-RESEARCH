# Initial Prompt
We need to devise a scorecard that will measure key features important to developers of agentic AI code assist applications/tools/platforms

While we are not at this time interested in selecting and scoring real applications/tools/platforms at this time we do realize it will be helpful to include tools such as Cursor IDE Agent, Continue.dev, GitHub Co-Pilot in your research in order to help identify features that will provide perceived value to developers and to organizations.

1. Research common features
2. Assemble to a scorecard template
3. Include your reasoning for identification and inclusion of each feature
4. Note any features which you considered but did not include in the final scorecard template

Our focus is on the developer experience but we must as a baseline score key features such as GCC Availability (which as a reminder largely covers practically all other security concerns) but then focus the remaining scorecard on Agentic AI features, MCP availability, and application features important to developers such as confident file edits by agentic AI.  Ability to use AWS Bedrock for model must also be a evaluation criteria.

Again, at this time we are focused on producing a solution agnostic scorecard but are only considering leading contemporary solutions as a thoughtful example to facilitate research.

# Clarifying Questions
How many total features or dimensions would you ideally like to see included in the scorecard?
A: We need to abstract features such that we end with some handful of towers such as GCC Availability|Confident File Updates by Agentic AI|Bedrock Availability|Developer Feature 1|Developer Feature 2|...

Should each feature have a standard scoring scale (e.g., 1–5 or 1–10)?
A: 1-5

Should we weight features differently based on importance (e.g., Agentic capabilities vs. baseline availability like GCC)?
A: Yes

Would you like this scorecard to be optimized for evaluation by individual developers, enterprise teams, or both?
A: Should be easy to understand, a concise and directionally accurate scorecard template

# Initial Response (ChatGPT o1 Deep research)
### 🔄 Revised Tower #5 — *Model-Integration, Confidence & Guardrails*  

Because we’re assuming every assistant can call the same frontier LLMs, what separates tools is **how well they integrate those models into the IDE, inject the right context, and wrap the results in safety/quality guardrails**.  
Below is the updated definition and 1-to-5 scale you can drop into the scorecard template (replacing the previous “Output Quality & Safety” tower).

---

#### What this tower measures  
| Aspect | What “good” looks like | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Context ingestion & prompt construction** | Indexes the full repo, performs semantic/RAG search, and builds rich prompts automatically | Better context → fewer hallucinations—even though everyone calls the same model |
| **Result-to-code application** | Streams diffs/patches in-place, lets devs preview & accept, and auto-creates commits | Integration quality = velocity **plus** traceability |
| **Confidence signalling** | Shows uncertainty scores, cites references/licences, or requires user approval on low-confidence edits | Prevents silent errors; boosts trust |
| **Safety guardrails** | Runs post-gen filters (vuln scans, licence checks, sensitive-data redaction) before code lands | Lets orgs adopt AI safely without a separate security review |

---

#### Scoring rubric (1 = minimal … 5 = excellent)

| Score | Concrete indicators |
|---|---|
| **1 – Minimal** | Pass-through chat or inline completions only. No repo indexing, no diff view; suggestions inserted verbatim. No vulnerability or licence checks. |
| **2** | Basic file-level context and a diff preview, but limited to current buffer. Simple profanity or secret-scan filter only. |
| **3 – Moderate** | Project-wide search to assemble prompts; diff or patch view across multiple files; optional “show references” or “public-code filter”. Security scanning is manual. |
| **4** | Automated semantic indexing of the whole repo; edits arrive as staged Git commits or PRs; assistant warns when confidence is low and flags licence or security issues. |
| **5 – Excellent** | Full RAG-style context engine + configurable context blocks (docs, tickets, API specs). Edits appear as verifiable diffs, unit-tests run (or build/linters) before suggestion is offered. Integrated SAST & licence trace-back are on by default. Assistant surfaces uncertainty levels and blocks unsafe changes unless the dev explicitly overrides. |

#### Evidence behind the rubric  

* **“Any models / any context” adapters** in Continue.dev highlight that integration-depth (not model choice) is its value prop. citeturn1view0  
* GitHub Copilot’s pipeline gathers file-, repo- and chat-level context, then post-filters responses for toxicity, vulnerabilities, and public-code matches—illustrating integration & guardrail layers. citeturn4view0  
* AWS CodeWhisperer runs SAST, secrets-detection, and licence reference logging *after* generation, showing how an assistant can hard-wire security scans into its flow. citeturn5view0  
* Continue’s “Edit” mode streams the model’s diff back into the highlighted region and lets the dev accept or reject it, exemplifying high-quality patch application. citeturn8view0

### How to use this revision  
1. **Rename** the fifth tower in your scorecard to **“Model-Integration, Confidence & Guardrails.”**  
2. **Swap in** the rubric above (keep the 1-5 scale).  
3. **Retain weighting** the same as before (unless you’d like to raise this tower’s weight now that advice quality is assumed equal).

Let me know if you’d like the full scorecard template re-rendered with this change or further tweaks to other towers!
