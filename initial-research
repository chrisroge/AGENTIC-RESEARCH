Organize this into a unified table, our goal is to evaluate offerings based on these criteria

# Reasoning

OK, let's explore organizing a unified table with columns for functional, non-functional, cost, and strategic requirements, along with decision criteria for build, buy, or wait. This could get interesting!

Thinking through a structured table with columns for criterion, build, buy, and wait criteria, while also considering functional and non-functional requirements. This captures all aspects holistically.

Organizing a table layout with columns for category, sub-category, detailed insights, non-functional requirements, cost and resource needs, strategic considerations, and decision criteria for assessing various offerings.

I’m building a unified table with rows for each major category—functional, non-functional, cost, resource, and strategic. Sub-rows delve into detailed criteria for each decision method: build, buy, or wait.

Constructing a comprehensive table with six columns—Area, Requirement/Criteria, Key Considerations, Build, Buy, and Wait—to systematically evaluate each criterion. Serving as a decision-making toolkit.

I'm thinking through the benefits and drawbacks of custom solutions, commercial products, and waiting for advancements, considering criteria like integration speed, customization, and control.

I'm piecing together a single table with sections for each major category and columns for requirement, description, and evaluation criteria, aiming for clarity and systematic assessment.

I'm creating a detailed table with sections for various requirements, including sub-rows for research capabilities, interactions, and other specific criteria, ensuring a comprehensive perspective.

### How to Use This Table

- **Compare Options**: For each functional or non-functional requirement, review the **Details/Key Points** column to confirm scope. Then gauge how well each approach (Build, Buy, Wait) aligns with your organization’s context.
- **Prioritize Requirements**: Some requirements may be absolute must-haves (e.g., strict security compliance) which might push you toward a Build or specific certified vendor solution. Others may be flexible or can evolve over time (good candidates for Wait).
- **Evaluate Cost vs. Strategic Benefit**: Balancing the total cost (upfront vs. ongoing) against the strategic control or speed to market often helps determine the best path—especially for advanced AI capabilities that are rapidly evolving.
- **Consider Hybrid Approaches**: You may decide to **build** certain custom modules (e.g., for highly confidential research or compliance) while **buying** commodity features (e.g., a standard writing or reporting interface). In some cases, you might **wait** on a portion of the functionality until the technology matures, creating a phased roadmap.

This unified table serves as a reference framework to **evaluate offerings** (internal builds, vendor products, or future solutions) based on the listed functional requirements, non-functional requirements, cost/resource factors, and strategic considerations.
