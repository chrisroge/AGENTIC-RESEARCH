Depth of Research: Do you prefer a high-level summary of capabilities (e.g., Available, Planned, Speculative) or a deep-dive analysis with examples, potential limitations, and comparisons to alternatives?
A: Available, Planned, Speculative should be your primary focus, include a succint statement and cite the source upon which you based your determination.

Primary Sources: Should I prioritize Microsoft’s official documentation, blog announcements, and whitepapers, or include independent analyst reviews and user reports as well?
A: Prioritize official documentation, then blog announcements and whitepapers, finally analyst reviews and media reports.  You may consider community discussion but only as speculation.

Format: Would you like the results as a structured document (e.g., a report with sections and tables) or a summarized response in chat?
A: Respond with a densely worded paper in paragraph format, avoid lists and bullets, we need a deep and densely worded writing of your research.  We are not interested in markdown formatting, we want plain text to maximize context window.

Scope of Comparison: Should I compare Microsoft 365 Co-Pilot’s research and iterative writing capabilities with competitors like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise, or focus solely on Microsoft’s solution?
A: We are not looking for any comparison, any such comparison has been performed and we are now focused on Microsoft 365 Co-Pilot.
