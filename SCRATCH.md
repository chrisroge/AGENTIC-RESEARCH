#### Analysis of Differences

From the comparison, it is evident that ChatGPT Gov and ChatGPT Enterprise share core AI capabilities, such as model access, custom GPT creation, and administrative tools. The primary differences lie in security and deployment:

- **Security**: ChatGPT Gov offers enhanced security measures to handle non-public sensitive data, with deployment in Azure Government cloud ensuring compliance with federal standards like FedRAMP. ChatGPT Enterprise, while secure, is designed for commercial use and is pursuing FedRAMP certifications but does not inherently include government-specific compliance.
- **Deployment**: ChatGPT Gov can be deployed in government-specific cloud environments, which is critical for agencies managing sensitive data, whereas ChatGPT Enterprise is typically deployed in commercial cloud settings.
- **Feature Specificity**: While both offer similar functional features, ChatGPT Gov's focus on government workflows might imply additional integrations or restrictions, though no specific differences in AI capabilities were identified in the sources.

#### Conclusion

Research suggests that ChatGPT Gov and ChatGPT-commercial (interpreted as ChatGPT Enterprise) have largely identical core features, including access to advanced AI models, custom GPT creation, and administrative tools. However, ChatGPT Gov is distinguished by its enhanced security measures and deployment options tailored for U.S. government agencies, ensuring compliance with federal standards. This focus on government-specific requirements, such as handling sensitive data in Azure Government cloud, may be an unexpected detail for users familiar with commercial offerings, highlighting its role in advancing AI adoption within the public sector.

This analysis is supported by multiple sources, including official announcements and industry reports, reflecting the nuanced differences driven by security and compliance needs.
