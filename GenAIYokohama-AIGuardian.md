It is officially designated an **Elite**‑tier partner in ServiceNow’s ecosystem – notably as a Consulting & Implementation partner (and also as an Elite Reseller) ([Plat4mation](https://www.servicenow.com/partners/partner-finder/plat4mation-bv.html#:~:text=Plat4mation%20%20Plat4mation%20is%20an,all%20applications%20and%20solutions%20Headquarters)) ([Plat4mation](https://www.servicenow.com/partners/partner-finder/plat4mation-bv.html#:~:text=Partner%20Types%20%20Operates%20in,Delivers%20implementations%2C%20consulting%2C%20transformation)) – reflecting broad platform expertise and a high customer‑satisfaction track record.  Plat4mation’s teams deliver end‑to‑end digital‑workflow solutions (from IT service and employee workflows to customer service management) and emphasize next‑generation capabilities like AI‑powered automation and security integration.  For example, it has published Now‑Platform offerings such as “Ready 4 GenAI” to accelerate generative‑AI adoption and “Connect4Tanium” to integrate Tanium endpoint security with ServiceNow (enhancing CMDB accuracy and SecOps) ([Plat4mation](https://www.servicenow.com/partners/partner-finder/plat4mation-bv.html#:~:text=Offering,Get%20Offering%20%20View%20All)).
