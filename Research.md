## Deep Research Prompt Summary

1. Ability to perform semantic searches across both internal FedRAMP data and external public/private data sources accessible via APIs or browsers
2. Capability to be hosted in a private cloud environment (specifically FedRAMP-compatible)
3. Strict data isolation with no retention or utilization of data for future model training
4. Agentic approach allowing interaction with command line, bash prompt, browser, and operating system
5. Preference for commercial off-the-shelf solutions, but open to considering open-source alternatives
6. Compliance with security considerations, though specific security standards were not being evaluated at this stage

The research aimed to identify platforms that could provide comprehensive understanding and solve business problems by integrating internal and external data sources while maintaining strict data privacy and security requirements within a FedRAMP-compliant environment.


Research and understanding availability of "deep research" agentic platforms or tools which can semantically search internal Fedramp data as well as public/private API accessible or browser accessible data to form a comprehensive understanding and solve business problems.

Requirements:

1. Deep research spanning internal and external data
2. Cab be hosted in a private cloud (Fedramp) environment
3. No data is retained or utilized for future model training

The platform or tool performing deep research must be hosted in or run within a private cloud, such as a Fedramp AWS VPC, and can search/crawl internal an external data.

The platform or tool should be able to interact with command line, bash prompt, browser, operating system. We are looking for a fully agentic approach to deep research.

We must avoid any models which can share or train on our data.

All security considerations should be well understood, we are not at this time evaluating specific security standards.

Our preference is commercial off the shelf but we will consider open source solutions

# Agentic Deep Research Platforms for Secure Private Cloud Deployment

Several advanced AI platforms can serve as _agentic deep research assistants_, orchestrating complex search and automation tasks across data sources and applications. Below we outline commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions—and a notable open-source framework—that meet the requirements of deep research capabilities, private cloud deployment (e.g. AWS GovCloud/FedRAMP), strict data isolation, SaaS/browser interactions, and optional OS-level actions. We highlight their capabilities, security measures, and compliance credentials.

## Moveworks AI Platform (FedRAMP-Ready)

**Moveworks** offers an _agentic AI platform_ that automates enterprise workflows using large language models, with an emphasis on security and compliance. It recently achieved **FedRAMP Ready** status, demonstrating its commitment to U.S. government security standards ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20we%20take%20immense,FedRAMP%20process%20and%20its%20requirements)). Moveworks provides a dedicated **GovCloud** environment hosted in AWS GovCloud (US) to ensure data segregation for public sector clients ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Working%20with%20Moveworks%20GovCloud)). Key capabilities include:

- **Internal & External Research** – Moveworks’ AI Assistant can retrieve information from internal knowledge bases and systems. It integrates natively with enterprise applications (ServiceNow, Salesforce, Workday, etc.) to look up data, answer queries, and perform actions ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=5,end)). Through its **extensive plugin library**, it can also connect to APIs or tools for external information as needed, enabling rich research across sources ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=helping%20enable%20a%20quick%20return,on%20your%20investment)).
- **Private Cloud Deployment** – The Moveworks **GovCloud** instance is a isolated cloud environment for government and other sensitive deployments, offering the same functionality as its commercial platform in a FedRAMP-aligned setting ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Working%20with%20Moveworks%20GovCloud)). This ensures agencies can use Moveworks entirely within a **FedRAMP Moderate** environment (authorization in progress) without data leaving the approved cloud.
- **Data Security & Isolation** – Moveworks embeds strict security; customer data is safeguarded and used only to serve that customer. The platform does not train its foundation models on client-specific data, per compliance requirements (a necessity for FedRAMP). All interactions are encrypted and privacy measures are in place ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Working%20with%20Moveworks%20GovCloud)).
- **Actionable Integrations** – The assistant can **take actions on SaaS platforms** via secure integrations. For example, it can create or update tickets, reset passwords, or query databases through provided connectors. These integrations “empower lookups, searches, and end-to-end automation” across systems ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=helping%20enable%20a%20quick%20return,on%20your%20investment)). While Moveworks primarily uses API integrations, it can emulate complex multi-step workflows to simulate human-like interactions. (For non-API systems, organizations could integrate Moveworks with RPA tools to drive web UIs if needed.)
- **Optional OS-Level Actions** – Out-of-the-box, Moveworks focuses on cloud apps, but it enables developers to build custom **AI agents** for bespoke tasks ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=6,AI%20solutions%20to%20your%20needs)). Using this extensibility, organizations could script OS-level or command-line actions (for example, running a script on a server) if the environment permits. Its plugin framework provides a path to execute custom code securely.

**Compliance**: Moveworks’ security-first design and FedRAMP-ready designation indicate alignment with strict government standards ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20we%20take%20immense,FedRAMP%20process%20and%20its%20requirements)). Data remains isolated to each customer’s instance. Deployments in AWS GovCloud inherit FedRAMP High controls (e.g. encryption, access control) and Moveworks plans to pursue **FedRAMP Moderate authorization** for its GovCloud environment ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=regulatory%20and%20compliance%20needs%20of,US%20customers%20handling%20sensitive%20workloads)).

## Aisera AI Copilot and Service Experience Platform

**Aisera** provides an _AI Service Experience_ platform (often described as an **AI Copilot**) that automates enterprise service and support through conversational AI and agents. It’s designed for secure enterprise use, offering **agentic AI** capabilities similar to Moveworks (Aisera is also recognized in ITSM AI solutions). Key features:

- **Internal Knowledge & External Data** – Aisera’s platform includes an **AI Search** module and **Agent Assist**, enabling it to semantically search internal repositories (knowledge bases, ticketing systems, documents) and provide answers or summaries. It can also incorporate **external data sources** as configured – administrators have control over which outside sources or internet data the AI may access ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Data%20Control%20%26%20User%20Consent)). This means Aisera can perform deep research combining internal data with web information (e.g. for customer support or research questions), while ensuring only approved sources are used.
- **Agentic Workflow Automation** – Aisera supports dynamic multi-step flows via its **Dynamic Action Flows** and **AI Orchestration** components ([Aisera : Agentic AI for the Enterprise](https://aisera.com/#:~:text=,Security%20and%20Compliance)). In practice, this allows the AI to not only retrieve information but also **execute tasks across SaaS applications**. For example, it can interact with IT service management tools, CRM systems, or HR portals – creating tickets, updating records, or routing requests – much like a human agent following up on a query. These actions can be triggered through API integrations or even UI simulation if needed. Aisera’s platform is extensible, often integrating with popular enterprise apps (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, etc.).
- **Browser and OS Interactions** – While Aisera primarily integrates at the API level, it can simulate user interactions when necessary. It partners with major collaboration and IT tools, and can operate via chat interfaces (Teams, Slack) to drive actions in other systems. For systems without direct integration, customers can leverage RPA alongside Aisera (the AI can hand off tasks to an RPA bot for GUI-based automation). Additionally, Aisera’s **Next Best Action** recommendations can guide agents or trigger automated scripts for remediation tasks ([Generative AI for State & Government Agencies](https://aisera.com/solutions/industries/government/#:~:text=AI)). In essence, it’s capable of orchestrating both cloud software actions and initiating **OS-level scripts** (e.g. running a diagnostic) through integrations with IT automation tools.
- **Data Privacy & Isolation** – Aisera strongly emphasizes that **customer data remains private**. Under its “TRAPS” trust framework (Trusted, Responsible, Auditable, Private, Secure), Aisera commits that your data **“remains yours”** – it does _not_ access or use your organization's data to train outside models ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Ensure%20Data%20Confidentiality%20and%20Protect,User%20Privacy)). Each client’s data and sessions are isolated, and **no data is retained for training on shared models** ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=With%20Aisera%2C%20your%20data%20remains,and%20practices%20like%20PII%20anonymization)) ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Data%20Control%20%26%20User%20Consent)). This addresses the strict data isolation requirement: Aisera’s cloud instances keep data separated and only use it to serve that customer’s queries. It also supports PII anonymization and other governance to protect sensitive info ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Ensure%20Data%20Confidentiality%20and%20Protect,User%20Privacy)).
- **Security & Compliance** – Aisera is enterprise-grade: it supports SSO, encryption, role-based access, and complies with standards like SOC 2 and GDPR (as indicated on its Trust Center). While not publicly FedRAMP-authorized as of this writing, Aisera has **government clients** (e.g. City of Denver ([Aisera : Agentic AI for the Enterprise](https://aisera.com/#:~:text=,Snowflake))) and offers a _Government_ industry solution with stringent data governance ([Generative AI for State & Government Agencies](https://aisera.com/solutions/industries/government/#:~:text=With%20the%20TRAPS%20framework%2C%20Aisera%E2%80%99s,trustworthy%20for%20public%20sector%20operations)). Its framework enforces compliance with data regulations and provides audit logs for all AI actions, which can assist in meeting requirements like HIPAA or ISO 27001. Organizations can deploy Aisera in a private cloud or VPC to ensure all data processing stays within approved boundaries.

Overall, Aisera acts as a secure AI research and task agent across enterprise data, with a design that **prevents data leakage or reuse** and enables **browser-like automation** through its integrations and optional RPA combination.

## Glean Work AI Agents

**Glean** – known for its enterprise search platform – has introduced **Glean Agents**, a horizontal Work AI platform for building and deploying AI agents in the enterprise. Glean Agents are specifically crafted to access **both internal and external knowledge** and perform multi-step tasks, making them suitable for “deep research” use cases:

- **Unified Data Access (Internal + External)** – Glean’s Agents have “the industry’s broadest access to knowledge,” spanning enterprise structured and unstructured data _as well as_ world internet data (historical and real-time) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=Now%20with%20the%20most%20complete,personal%20tasks%20and%20business%20processes)) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=%2A%20Real,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)). This means a Glean agent can, for example, search your internal SharePoint and knowledge bases **via semantic embeddings**, and also pull in relevant information from web search or external databases. Real-time internet search integration is built-in, enriching the agent’s answers with up-to-date external insights ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=%2A%20Real,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)). All retrieved information is verified and cited, which is critical for trust.
- **Agentic Reasoning & Workflows** – Glean’s platform includes an **agentic reasoning engine** that allows agents to plan multi-step workflows and take actions, not just answer questions ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,a%20library%20of%20actions%20to)). Employees can create custom agents by describing goals in natural language (a **no-code agent builder**) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=re)). The system then auto-generates a complex sequence of steps to achieve the goal, which the user can refine. For instance, an employee could ask an agent to “gather all recent research on topic X and draft a summary email,” and the agent will search internal files, find web articles, aggregate findings, then compose an email draft. Glean provides a library of pre-built actions and an expanding library of connectors, so agents can log into apps, query databases, or invoke APIs as needed ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=Palo%20Alto%2C%20CA%20,every%20stage%20of%20customer%20adoption)) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)).
- **SaaS and Tool Integrations** – With **100+ pre-built connectors**, Glean can interact with a wide range of SaaS solutions (from Salesforce and Slack to Atlassian, Databricks, and more) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,agent%20builder%2C%20agent%20orchestration%2C%20unified)). Agents can thus execute tasks like updating a CRM entry, creating a Jira ticket, or fetching analytics from BI tools – all through the same natural language interface. While Glean primarily uses direct integrations, it essentially _simulates human actions_ on these apps (logging in via secure OAuth, performing the allowed operations). This covers the requirement of simulating user interactions with web apps. If a needed app lacks an API, custom integration or RPA could be used in tandem, though Glean’s focus is on native connectors.
- **Optional OS-Level Actions** – Glean Agents can analyze structured data and even run SQL queries or script-like operations (for example, via Databricks integration) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=,from%20internal%20and%20external%20sources)). Direct OS command execution isn’t a primary feature, but an agent could be configured to trigger a script on an internal server (through an API call or webhook). Glean’s architecture is extensible, so organizations can define new “actions” that might include running a shell command on a secure server, if needed, through an intermediary service.
- **Security & Governance** – Glean places strong emphasis on **active data and AI governance**. It enforces permission checks on all data access (agents only retrieve data the user is authorized to see) ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=external%20sources)). Its governance dashboard scans for sensitive data exposure and provides admins control over what data sources an agent can tap ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=external%20sources)). All interactions can be logged for audit. While not FedRAMP certified, Glean’s platform was built with enterprise security in mind – data stays within the customer’s cloud tenant, and Glean’s **“universal knowledge”** approach comes with controls to prevent leakage of confidential data ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=external%20sources)). For example, an admin can disable internet access for certain agents handling sensitive internal data. Glean supports major compliance needs (SOC 2, GDPR) and could be deployed in a private cloud configuration if required by an enterprise.

In summary, Glean Agents provide a **comprehensive research assistant** that can scour internal and external sources and automate follow-up actions, all under a robust security governance model ([Introducing Glean Agents, Expanding the Work AI Platform and Making AI Agents a Reality for Enterprises | Glean Press](https://www.glean.com/press/glean-makes-horizontal-ai-agents-for-enterprises-expands-work-ai-with-glean-agents#:~:text=external%20sources)). This makes it a strong COTS solution for organizations looking to leverage agentic AI while keeping data secure.

## IBM watsonx Orchestrate

**IBM watsonx Orchestrate** is a generative AI and automation solution enabling businesses to create personalized AI assistants and agents for workflow automation ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=watsonx%20Orchestrate%3A%20AI%20for%20business,productivity)). It’s a _platform toolkit_ that organizations can host in their private cloud or on-premises (e.g., via IBM Cloud Pak or IBM Cloud for Government) to meet strict isolation requirements. Notable aspects:

- **Integration of AI and Automation Tools** – Watsonx Orchestrate is designed to **“connect to any AI model or automation tool”**, allowing flexible integration of both IBM and third-party services ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=IBM%C2%AE%20watsonx%E2%84%A2%20Orchestrate%C2%AE%20puts%20AI,and%20processes%20with%20generative%20AI)). This means it can use internal foundation models or even OpenAI/Anthropic models (if allowed) alongside connecting to RPA bots or existing scripts. For internal deep research, it can plug into an enterprise’s document repositories (leveraging IBM Watson Discovery or vector databases for semantic search) to find information, then utilize automation “skills” to act on that information. Essentially, Orchestrate provides a framework to build an AI agent with access to _both_ knowledge (via AI search) and action capabilities.
- **Private Cloud Deployment (FedRAMP-ready)** – IBM has a long track record of supporting government and secure deployments. **IBM Cloud for Government** (IC4G) is FedRAMP High authorized ([IBM Cloud for Government and IBM SmartCloud for Government Meet FedRAMP High Security Requirements - IBM Blog](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ic4g-and-scg-meet-fedramp-high-security-requirements/#:~:text=IBM%20Cloud%20for%20Government%20,FedRAMP)), and Watsonx Orchestrate can be deployed in such an environment or in an AWS/Azure GovCloud. IBM also offers Orchestrate through **Cloud Pak for Data** for on-premises or VPC installation, ensuring **complete data isolation** (all data and model processing stays within the client’s controlled infrastructure). IBM’s FedRAMP-authorized cloud offerings mean agencies can use Orchestrate while meeting FedRAMP High security controls ([IBM Cloud for Government and IBM SmartCloud for Government Meet FedRAMP High Security Requirements - IBM Blog](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ic4g-and-scg-meet-fedramp-high-security-requirements/#:~:text=IBM%20Cloud%20for%20Government%20,FedRAMP)).
- **Deep Research Abilities** – Orchestrate allows building AI assistants that can perform complex queries on internal data. For instance, an HR agent could search across internal HR policies (using embeddings to understand context) and external legal databases to answer a compliance question. Because Orchestrate is part of IBM’s **watsonx** suite, it can leverage IBM’s large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. It doesn’t natively browse the public web, but if external research is needed, one can integrate a web search API or feed external data into the model. The platform’s strength lies in combining **NLP understanding** with enterprise automation – thus an agent can read a policy document, summarize it, then automatically draft an email or update a form as a follow-up.
- **Workflow and SaaS Automation** – IBM provides a **Skills Catalog** and “Skills Studio” to integrate common business actions (e.g., create ServiceNow ticket, update Salesforce record) ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=Orchestrator%20Agent%20AI%20assistant%20builder,Skills%20Studio%20Prebuilt%20skills%20catalog)) ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=Explore%20Orchestrator%20Agent)). Using a _low-code interface_, users can orchestrate multi-step workflows in natural language (“assistants in minutes—no coding required” ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=Explore%20Orchestrator%20Agent))). The agent can log into web apps or call APIs just like a human would – for example, an IT agent could reset a user’s password by invoking Active Directory commands, or a sales agent could retrieve the latest pricing from an internal database and send it to a client via email, all automatically. For applications without APIs, Orchestrate can integrate with **RPA bots** (IBM has an RPA solution, or it can trigger third-party RPA) to simulate UI interactions. This covers the requirement of interacting with SaaS via a browser when no direct integration is available.
- **OS-Level and Scripting Actions** – Because Orchestrate can **“seamlessly connect… to automation tools”** ([IBM watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-orchestrate#:~:text=generative%20AI)), it is capable of executing OS-level commands through those tools. For example, an agent could be configured to run a shell script or a batch process on a server by interfacing with an orchestration tool like Ansible or an RPA bot on that machine. IBM’s own automation portfolio (UrbanCode, Turbonomic, etc.) can be tied in, enabling infrastructure-level actions if needed. Thus, an AI agent could conceivably fetch data from logs or run diagnostic commands in response to a user request, under proper safeguards.
- **Security & Compliance** – IBM Watsonx Orchestrate inherits IBM’s enterprise-grade security practices. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and the platform supports access controls and audit logging. Running Orchestrate in a private instance means **no data is shared with IBM or any third-party** aside from what the user chooses to integrate. IBM’s models can be deployed such that they do not learn from interactions (no updates to the base model from user prompts unless explicitly enabled in a controlled way). IBM as a company is compliant with **SOC 2, ISO 27001**, etc., and for federal clients, the solution can be delivered under **FedRAMP High** via IBM’s cloud or a government cloud partner ([IBM Cloud for Government and IBM SmartCloud for Government Meet FedRAMP High Security Requirements - IBM Blog](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ic4g-and-scg-meet-fedramp-high-security-requirements/#:~:text=IBM%20Cloud%20for%20Government%20,FedRAMP)). This makes Watsonx Orchestrate suitable for even highly regulated environments that require strict data custody and zero leakage.

In essence, IBM Watsonx Orchestrate is a flexible agent platform that can be privately hosted, combining **deep semantic search**, **LLM reasoning**, and **powerful automation hooks** to accomplish research and tasks—while aligning with stringent security/compliance demands.

## Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP)

**Palantir AIP** is an _enterprise AI platform_ focused on integrating large language models into organization-specific data and operations. Palantir’s solution is notable for high security environments (defense, government, finance) where data isolation is paramount. Key points:

- **Private Network Deployment** – AIP is explicitly designed to run **within an enterprise’s private network or cloud**, so LLM capabilities can be brought to sensitive data without exposing it externally ([Palantir Foundry AIP - Unit8](https://unit8.com/resources/palantir-foundry-aip/#:~:text=In%20April%202023%2C%20the%20company,integrated%20directly%20into%20the%20platform)). In Palantir’s architecture, the model (which can be an open-source LLM or a hosted model via API) is integrated in **Foundry**, Palantir’s data platform. All prompts and outputs are handled within the secure environment; if using a third-party model API, Palantir implements gateways to ensure no sensitive raw data is leaked in prompts ([AIP capabilities • Palantir](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/platform-overview/aip-capabilities//#:~:text=LLM%20security)) ([AIP capabilities • Palantir](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/platform-overview/aip-capabilities//#:~:text=To%20understand%20how%20LLMs%20securely,by%20selecting%20Palantir%20AIP%20FAQs)). (They provide documentation on how they securely process prompts with third-party LLMs, including encryption and optional on-prem deployment of models.)
- **FedRAMP High and Government-Grade Security** – Palantir’s Federal Cloud Service is **FedRAMP High** authorized, and this accreditation _“extends across Palantir’s entire product suite, including AIP”_ ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=Management%20Program%20for%20its%20two,hosted%20offerings)). Palantir AIP can thus be used for **Impact Level 5/6** DoD data and other highly sensitive workloads ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)). Compliance-wise, Palantir meets a host of standards (FedRAMP, DoD IL6, FISMA High, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) ([Palantir Trust and Security Portal | Powered by SafeBase](https://palantir.safebase.us/?itemName=data_privacy&source=click#:~:text=PlusDISPDoD%20IL5DoD%20IL6ENSFedRAMP%20HighFISMA%20HighGDPRHIPAAISO,27018ISO%209001SOC%201SOC%202SOC%203TISAXVPAT)), making it one of the most compliance-ready AI platforms. Data is strictly isolated per customer/government tenant, and Palantir’s contracts often allow on-prem deployments (for instance, in classified networks) meaning absolutely no external data sharing. No AIP usage data is used to train any models by default – agencies can even use fully local models if required.
- **Deep Research Capabilities** – Palantir AIP allows organizations to apply LLM **“intuition”** to their private data ([Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/aip/#:~:text=Palantir%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Platform%20Explore,platform%20%C2%B7%20Time%3A%203%20mns)). This means an AIP agent can ingest and reason over large internal datasets (e.g. millions of records, reports, sensor logs) and combine that with external data that is brought into the secure environment. For example, an intelligence analyst could ask an AIP-powered system to gather and summarize all reports about a certain topic from internal databases, and also incorporate relevant news from curated external feeds (Palantir can pull in OSINT data feeds into Foundry). The agent can perform multi-step analysis: first querying a knowledge graph, then asking follow-up questions, etc., to produce a detailed report that normally would take human analysts days. Palantir calls these _“Deep Research”_ or _analyst_ workflows, and thanks to Palantir’s efficient backend, even very large queries can be handled quickly.
- **Action Orchestration (Tool Usage)** – A key differentiator of Palantir AIP is its focus on not just Q&A, but taking **actions based on AI reasoning**. AIP can integrate with operational systems – for instance, if an AIP agent in a military context determines that a certain pattern is a threat, it could suggest a response and even execute a predefined script to deploy resources (with human approval in the loop). Palantir’s platform supports creating secure “action nodes” that an LLM can trigger, with governance. This might include running a simulation, updating a database record, or calling an API in another system. There are guardrails – often a human must review actions before execution in high-stakes settings – but the capability for the AI to drive real-world changes exists (Palantir demonstrated an AI agent controlling a drone in a defense scenario, under supervision). For enterprise use, an AIP agent could automatically flag anomalies in data and then execute a containment script in a cybersecurity tool, for example.
- **Browser/SaaS Interaction** – While Palantir AIP doesn’t literally drive a web browser UI in the way RPA tools do, it achieves integration through its platform connectors. Palantir Foundry can connect to SaaS applications via APIs or data pipelines. Thus, if an analyst’s workflow needs data from a SaaS app, the AIP agent can query that app’s data via Foundry. If a direct integration is not available, Palantir’s approach would be to bring that data into Foundry (or use something like **Palantir FedStart** for partners to integrate SaaS securely ([Palantir FedStart - Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/palantirtechnologies1585670280063.palantir_fedstart?tab=overview#:~:text=Palantir%20FedStart%20,of%20the%20time%20and%20cost))). For one-off web research needs (like reading a specific webpage), an AIP user might use a separate secure browsing tool and feed the text to the AI. However, for structured interactions, Palantir would maintain a controlled interface rather than letting the AI freely roam the internet (to preserve security). In summary, AIP emphasizes **controlled, auditable tool use** over open-ended browser automation.
- **OS-Level and Custom Commands** – Palantir’s platform can execute code and pipelines. An AIP agent can invoke custom Python or SQL as part of a solution (for instance, using the “Use LLM” node in a data pipeline to generate results ([AIP capabilities • Palantir](https://palantir.com/docs/foundry/platform-overview/aip-capabilities//#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20with%20permission%2C%20you%20can,Builder%2C%20such%20as%20the%20following))). If OS-level actions are needed, Palantir Apollo can deploy code to systems, so an agent could trigger a pre-defined deployment or script execution in the enterprise environment. Everything is logged and must be pre-configured by developers, which ensures no unexpected system commands are run without oversight.

In summary, Palantir AIP is a **highly secure, compliant AI agent platform** that embeds LLMs into enterprise workflows ([Palantir Foundry AIP - Unit8](https://unit8.com/resources/palantir-foundry-aip/#:~:text=In%20April%202023%2C%20the%20company,integrated%20directly%20into%20the%20platform)). It excels in scenarios requiring strict data governance, offering powerful deep-research analytics and the ability to act on insights in real systems (with robust safety checks). Its FedRAMP High authorization and use in defense contexts attest to its security pedigree ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)).

## RPA-Based AI Agents (UiPath, Automation Anywhere, etc.)

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) platforms are another category of solution that can fulfill the “agentic research” requirements when augmented with AI. Tools like **UiPath**, **Automation Anywhere**, and **Microsoft Power Automate** have begun integrating large language models to create AI-driven agents capable of both web navigation and OS-level actions. For example, **UiPath** – a leading RPA vendor – now offers an AI-powered automation cloud that is **FedRAMP-authorized** for government use ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=New%20York%2C%20NY%2C%20March%2026%2C,accessed%20by%20federal%20government%20agencies)). Key characteristics of RPA-based approaches:

- **Browser and Application Simulation** – RPA bots excel at **simulating human interactions in GUIs**. They can control a web browser (click links, fill forms, press buttons) and desktop applications just like a person would. By incorporating an LLM as a “brain”, an RPA bot can decide _what_ actions to take on the fly. This directly meets the requirement of interacting with SaaS via a browser with human-like behavior. For instance, an AI-augmented RPA agent could log into a web-based ERP system, navigate to a report section, download data, and then analyze it with an LLM. UiPath and others have shown demos of using GPT-4 to interpret instructions and drive RPA workflows ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)).
- **Internal and External Data Access** – RPA can interface with internal systems (databases, legacy apps, fileshares) and also scrape data from external websites. While traditional RPA had no built-in “semantic search”, adding an LLM means the agent can parse unstructured data it encounters. We can script RPA to call internal APIs or use an **embedding-based search** on documents (for example, using an open-source vector search within an automation script) – effectively giving the RPA agent the ability to perform _deep research_ across internal knowledge. For external info, the RPA can query search engines or open web pages and let the LLM read them. One could integrate an official API (like Bing Search API) or simply automate a browser-based search.
- **Private Cloud Deployment** – Most RPA solutions can be deployed on-premises or in a private cloud. UiPath, for example, offers an **Automation Cloud for Public Sector** that is FedRAMP Moderate and can be run in GovCloud ([About Automation Cloud Public Sector - UiPath Documentation](https://docs.uipath.com/automation-cloud-public-sector/automation-cloud-public-sector/latest/admin-guide/about-automation-cloud-public-sector#:~:text=About%20Automation%20Cloud%20Public%20Sector,mandated%20by%20the%20Federal)). Agencies can also run UiPath entirely on their own VMs for complete control. This means the AI-driven RPA agent’s **execution and data** stay within the organization’s infrastructure. No data needs to be sent to an external LLM service if using a self-hosted model; alternatively, if using a cloud LLM (like Azure OpenAI), that can be done within a FedRAMP-certified environment ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=New%20York%2C%20NY%2C%20March%2026%2C,accessed%20by%20federal%20government%20agencies)).
- **Data Isolation & Non-Training** – When running RPA locally (or in a dedicated cloud instance), **no interaction data is shared** beyond the organization. If an external LLM API is used, most vendors (Microsoft, OpenAI via Azure) have options to disable data logging and training on prompts. In the case of UiPath’s AI, it combines **Generative AI and Specialized AI** in a way that keeps the data safe – government clients’ automations run in a segregated cloud with no leakage ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=As%20an%20authorized%20provider%20of,of%20international%20public%20sector%20organizations)). Thus, an RPA-based agent can be configured to satisfy strict isolation: all web traffic from the agent can go through secure gateways, and all logs can be kept in-house.
- **OS-Level Commands** – RPA’s core strength is interacting with the operating system. An AI agent built on RPA can easily execute OS commands, run scripts, manipulate files, or launch programs as part of its workflow. For example, an agent could receive a request to “generate a compliance report,” and it might run a SQL script on a local database, then open Excel to create a spreadsheet, and finally email it – all of which involve OS-level operations orchestrated by the bot. The addition of the LLM allows the agent to handle unexpected situations (like a pop-up window) intelligently by “reading” the screen and deciding how to close it or by adjusting its plan.
- **COTS Availability** – UiPath and Automation Anywhere are **commercial platforms available off-the-shelf** with enterprise support. They now include AI capabilities (UiPath has an AI Center and integrations for GPT models). Microsoft’s Power Automate with **Copilot** is another example, allowing natural language to create automation flows. These are established vendors with compliance attestations (SOC 2, ISO 27018, and now FedRAMP for some), making them acceptable for enterprise and government adoption.

In summary, an RPA-based solution can serve as an _“embodied” AI agent_, directly interacting with apps and systems. When combined with an internal knowledge base and LLM reasoning, it meets all listed requirements: it can search across data sources, run in a secured environment, maintain data isolation, use a browser like a human, and execute OS commands. The trade-off is that assembling such an agent might require more configuration (to define the steps and integrate the LLM) compared to purpose-built AI platforms. However, for organizations that already use RPA, this approach leverages existing infrastructure and adds intelligence to it.

## Open-Source Frameworks (e.g. SambaNova/CrewAI Deep Research Agent)

In addition to COTS products, there are open-source frameworks that enable building a custom agentic research platform meeting all the requirements. One notable example is the **open-source deep research agent framework** announced by SambaNova in partnership with CrewAI ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=3,increasing%20exponentially%2C%20especially%20with%20OpenAI)) ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=Today%20SambaNova%20has%20answered%20the,enterprises%20solve%20their%20biggest%20challenges)):

- **Enterprise Data + External Web** – This framework was designed to let enterprises build their own multi-agent system with access to both private data and the public internet ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=1,increasing%20exponentially%2C%20especially%20with%20OpenAI)). It supports **retrieval-augmented generation**: agents can perform semantic searches on internal documents (using embeddings) and also issue web search queries or scrape websites for information. For instance, an enterprise can configure an agent that first queries an internal knowledge base and then searches the web for any missing pieces, compiling a comprehensive answer with citations (similar to how tools like Perplexity.ai work, but now under the enterprise’s full control).
- **On-Premises Deployment** – As an open-source solution, it can be deployed fully on-prem or in a private cloud, even leveraging specialized hardware (SambaNova’s AI systems) for acceleration ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=Today%20SambaNova%20has%20answered%20the,enterprises%20solve%20their%20biggest%20challenges)). **All data stays within the company’s environment.** This addresses security: none of the prompts or documents need to go to an outside service. The agents can use open-source LLMs (like Meta’s LLaMA family or others) hosted locally, ensuring **no external API calls** that might leak data. SambaNova highlights that this approach keeps _“enterprise data... private on-premise”_ which was a limitation with many cloud-based research tools ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=1,increasing%20exponentially%2C%20especially%20with%20OpenAI)).
- **No Data Retention/Training** – Because you’re running the models yourself (or using an open model), there is zero risk of your data being used to train someone else’s model. The open agents can be configured not to store conversation history unless you choose. In essence, **data isolation is guaranteed by design** – your data never leaves your infrastructure and the models can be static (not continually trained on new inputs unless you want to fine-tune them internally). This was a key motivation: to eliminate security concerns that _“existing deep research tools”_ couldn’t address ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=1,increasing%20exponentially%2C%20especially%20with%20OpenAI)).
- **Tool Use and OS Interaction** – Open-source agent frameworks like **CrewAI** allow the creation of various tool-using agents. For example, an agent can be equipped with a **browser tool**, an **HTTP request tool**, a **shell command tool**, etc. This means the agent can simulate a user on a browser (via a headless browsing library or API calls) and execute OS commands directly in a controlled sandbox. In the CrewAI deep research example, they set up agents like a general search agent, a focused research agent, and even a financial analysis agent ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=The%20framework%20by%20default%20comes,own%20data%20source%20as%20well)) ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=After%20getting%20some%20basic%20information%2C,the%20number%20of%20tokens%20required)). The agents can take a query, break it into sub-tasks (search, analyze, compile), and even run code if needed to compute something. With open frameworks, there’s full flexibility to script what the agent can do – including running Python scripts, calling database queries, or any OS-level operation you permit. This satisfies the optional OS interaction criterion fully: you have the freedom to grant the agent shell access (often done in a sandbox or via plugins that execute commands).
- **Extendibility and Custom Actions** – Being open source, these frameworks are **highly extensible**. You can add connectors to your internal systems (APIs, databases) or define new “tools” for the agent (e.g., a Salesforce API tool or a VMware control tool). CrewAI, for instance, is independent of proprietary agent libraries and lets developers add new agents or tools easily ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=Research%20agent%2C%20and%20a%20Financial,own%20data%20source%20as%20well)). This means you can tailor the agent to your enterprise’s unique mix of data sources and applications – a level of customization often not possible in closed platforms.
- **Performance and Costs** – SambaNova reported that running these agents on their hardware or optimized cloud can be **3× faster and significantly cheaper** than using API-based models ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=Today%20SambaNova%20has%20answered%20the,enterprises%20solve%20their%20biggest%20challenges)) ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=faster%20than%20any%20other%20GPU,4o)). While performance isn’t directly a security requirement, it does matter for practical use (faster research turnaround and the ability to iterate quickly). Moreover, using local models avoids recurring token costs that come with API calls ([Open-Source Deep Research Agents: Enterprise-Grade Speed, Security & Saving them Millions](https://sambanova.ai/blog/open-source-deep-research-agents#:~:text=faster%20than%20any%20other%20GPU,4o)). Lower cost encourages more extensive use of deep research agents without budget concern, which can indirectly increase adoption in secure environments (where budget cycles can be tight).

Other open-source options in this vein include **LangChain** (a popular framework for chaining LLM calls and tools) and **AutoGPT/BabyAGI** style agents, which can be self-hosted. These require engineering effort to set up and harden, but they can meet all the specified requirements if configured correctly. For instance, one could deploy an **AutoGPT** agent with a local LLM (ensuring data never leaves), hook it up to an internal vector database for semantic search, give it access to a headless Chrome for web browsing, and whitelist certain OS commands it can run. This would achieve deep research and multi-step task execution similar to the commercial platforms – though without the out-of-the-box user interface and support that vendors provide.

**Security Considerations for Open Source**: When rolling your own agent, it’s crucial to implement sandboxing and permissioning (so the AI doesn’t execute destructive actions). Enterprise users often run open-source AI agents in isolated network enclaves, with access only to approved internal APIs or a proxy for web access, to maintain security. The advantage is you have **full transparency** into the code, and you can enforce any policy (for example, log every tool use, require confirmation for certain actions, etc.). Many enterprises experimenting with this route use open models like **Meta LLaMA 2** or **Falcon** which are permitted for commercial use and can be deployed in-house – thus no data is shared and even the model weights stay under company control.

---

**In conclusion**, the landscape of agentic deep research platforms includes both **enterprise-ready solutions** and **open frameworks** that can be adapted. Platforms like Moveworks, Aisera, Glean, IBM Orchestrate, and Palantir AIP offer robust COTS options with varying focuses (from IT service automation to general knowledge agents), all emphasizing security measures such as data encryption, role-based access, and compliance certifications. Many are already used in government or highly regulated industries, evidenced by FedRAMP authorizations and similar standards ([UiPath Announces FedRAMP® Authorization for Its Automation Cloud™ Public Sector | UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-announces-fedramp-authorization#:~:text=New%20York%2C%20NY%2C%20March%2026%2C,accessed%20by%20federal%20government%20agencies)) ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)). These solutions can search internal data semantically and reach out to external sources (either via built-in web search integrations or configurable connectors), then synthesize results using LLMs. They also provide mechanisms to perform actions – whether via API, RPA, or direct tool integration – essentially _simulating a human researcher or operator_.

When strict data isolation is a must, deploying the AI in a private cloud or on-premises environment ensures no sensitive information ever leaves your control. All the above solutions support such deployment models, and they **do not retain or reuse your data for training** their models (either by policy, as with enterprise SaaS like Aisera ([TRAPS Framework | Trusted and Responsible AI with Aisera](https://aisera.com/traps/#:~:text=Ensure%20Data%20Confidentiality%20and%20Protect,User%20Privacy)), or by the architecture of a self-hosted model). This guarantees that your proprietary data or research queries won’t leak into public AI model training.

Finally, for organizations willing to invest in customization, open-source agent frameworks (or a combination of RPA + LLM) provide a path to meet these requirements without vendor lock-in. The choice may come down to **build vs. buy**: COTS platforms offer faster time-to-value and support, whereas open source offers maximal control and privacy. In either case, the capabilities of deep research across internal/external data, secure private-cloud hosting, no data leakage, rich integration with SaaS, and OS-level action execution are all achievable today with the state of AI agents and automation. The examples and platforms cited above illustrate that this is not theoretical – multiple solutions already **deliver on these requirements** in production settings, enabling powerful AI-driven research while keeping data secure and compliant.

### Research and understanding availability of "deep research" agentic platforms or tools which can semantically search internal Fed-ramp data as well as public/private API accessible or browser accessible data to form a comprehensive understanding and solve business problems.

Requirements:

1. Deep research spanning internal and external data
2. Cab be hosted in a private cloud (Fed-ramp) environment
3. No data is retained or utilized for future model training

The platform or tool performing deep research must be hosted in or run within a private cloud, such as a Fed-ramp AWS VPC, and can search/crawl internal an external data.

The platform or tool should be able to interact with command line, bash prompt, browser, operating system. We are looking for a fully agentic approach to deep research.

We must avoid any models which can share or train on our data.

All security considerations should be well understood, we are not at this time evaluating specific security standards.

Our preference is commercial off the shelf but we will consider open source solutions

Internal Data sources can be any API accessible data sources, prioritize semantic search, assume we need some capability to generate embeddings for internal data

We should consider the need for agents to utilize tools in a human like fashion, such as interacting with SAAS solutions via browser

OS level is a plus, the ability to generate and run logic can only enhance the overall agentic capability

LLM, strict data isolation, hybrid is no critical

### Thank you for the detailed request. Before I begin the research, I’d like to clarify a few points to ensure I find the most relevant deep research platforms for your needs:

1. **Preferred Deployment**: Do you require on-premise deployment options, or is a private FedRAMP cloud (AWS GovCloud, Azure Gov, etc.) sufficient?
2. **Public vs. Private API Search**: Do you have specific public/private data sources that the tool should be able to access, or should it be generally capable of interfacing with any API-accessible data?
3. **Browser and OS Interaction**: Do you need explicit support for browser automation and OS-level interactions (e.g., Puppeteer, Selenium, RPA capabilities)?
4. **Embedding & Semantic Search**: Should the platform have native embedding generation, or can it integrate with external embedding models (e.g., OpenAI’s ADA, Cohere, etc.)?
5. **Security Considerations**: While you’re not evaluating specific security standards, should the solution have prior FedRAMP compliance, or are general strong security practices sufficient?
6. **Preferred Providers**: Are there any companies or providers you’re already considering or prefer (e.g., Palantir, Scale AI, Databricks, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)?

Once I have these details, I’ll conduct deep research into the best available solutions that fit your requirements.

### Preferred Deployment: Do you require on-premise deployment options, or is a private FedRAMP cloud (AWS GovCloud, Azure Gov, etc.) sufficient?

A: preference is private cloud, AWS GovCloud and Azure Gov are ideal

Public vs. Private API Search: Do you have specific public/private data sources that the tool should be able to access, or should it be generally capable of interfacing with any API-accessible data?
A: Generally capable of utilizing internal and external APIs

Browser and OS Interaction: Do you need explicit support for browser automation and OS-level interactions (e.g., Puppeteer, Selenium, RPA capabilities)?
A: This is a value add

Embedding & Semantic Search: Should the platform have native embedding generation, or can it integrate with external embedding models (e.g., OpenAI’s ADA, Cohere, etc.)?
A: If we can avoid architecture our own embedding approach to internal knowledge that is a value add

Security Considerations: While you’re not evaluating specific security standards, should the solution have prior FedRAMP compliance, or are general strong security practices sufficient?
A: FedRamp is a must have

Preferred Providers: Are there any companies or providers you’re already considering or prefer (e.g., Palantir, Scale AI, Databricks, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)?
A: No preference, prioritize frontier capabilities where problem solving and reasoning are concerned

Understood! I will research deep research agentic platforms that can semantically search internal FedRAMP data, as well as external API-accessible data, while operating within a private cloud environment like AWS GovCloud or Azure Gov. The solutions must prioritize strict data isolation, avoid model training on customer data, and enable advanced problem-solving capabilities. I will also assess options that integrate native embedding generation for internal data and provide value-added features like browser automation and OS-level interactions. Expect a detailed analysis of commercially available (COTS) and open-source options that align with FedRAMP compliance and strict security requirements.

# Deep Research Agentic Platforms for FedRAMP Environments

## Key Requirements and Challenges

Deploying an AI “research agent” in a government context demands balancing advanced capabilities with strict security. Such a platform must:

- **Span Internal & External Data:** Perform semantic search over internal FedRAMP data (e.g. private documents, knowledge bases) and external data via APIs or web, to gather comprehensive information.
- **Private Cloud Deployment:** Run within a FedRAMP-compliant cloud (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, etc.) or on-premises, ensuring data **isolation** from public services.
- **Data Security & Isolation:** Guarantee that no customer data is retained or used to train models beyond the immediate session. (For example, Azure OpenAI and AWS Bedrock both state they do _not_ use client prompts or data to improve their models ([Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#:~:text=,available%20exclusively%20for%20your%20use)) ([Data protection - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)).)
- **Semantic Search & Embeddings:** Support embedding generation for internal content to enable semantic search, either natively or via integration with an embedding model. This allows the agent to find relevant information by meaning, not just keywords.
- **Tool Use & Automation:** Go beyond Q&A – use tools like web browsers (headless automation via Puppeteer/Selenium) and perform OS-level or API-driven actions. An _“agentic”_ platform should autonomously plan and execute multi-step tasks using such tools ([Agentic AI: 4 reasons why it’s the next big thing in AI research | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/agentic-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20refers%20to%20a,ML%29%C2%A0models%20were%20trained)).
- **Advanced Reasoning:** Leverage frontier LLM capabilities (GPT-4 class or fine-tuned models) for complex problem-solving, chain-of-thought reasoning, and handling of non-trivial queries. This includes reasoning over retrieved facts and deciding when/how to invoke tools.

Meeting all the above in a FedRAMP environment is non-trivial. Below, we evaluate leading commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and open-source solutions against these needs, with a focus on security and FedRAMP compliance.

## Commercial Solutions (COTS)

### Azure OpenAI (Azure GovCloud) with Cognitive Search

**Overview:** Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service – now FedRAMP High authorized in Azure Government ([Azure OpenAI, including GPT-4o, Approved as a Service within the FedRAMP High Authorization for Azure Government - Azure Government](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-openai-fedramp-high-for-government/#:~:text=,High%20and%20DoD%20IL4%2FIL5%20Authorization)) ([Microsoft Azure OpenAI Receives FedRAMP High Authorization](https://potomacofficersclub.com/news/microsoft-azure-openai-receives-fedramp-high-authorization/#:~:text=Microsoft%20Azure%20OpenAI%20Receives%20FedRAMP,to%20train%20the%20AI%20model)) – offers GPT-4 and related models in a compliant environment. Agencies can deploy GPT-4 (including the optimized _“GPT-4o”_ model) in their GovCloud tenant, ensuring data never leaves the tenant. Azure guarantees prompts and outputs are not used to train the base models or shared with OpenAI ([Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#:~:text=,available%20exclusively%20for%20your%20use)), addressing data isolation.

**Semantic Search:** Azure provides **Azure Cognitive Search** with a vector search feature that can be integrated with Azure OpenAI. One common pattern is to index internal documents into Cognitive Search (or another vector store), generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI’s embedding model, and let GPT-4 ground its answers on those results (a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach). This yields semantic search on internal data combined with GPT’s reasoning ([Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#:~:text=,available%20exclusively%20for%20your%20use)). Azure OpenAI also supports plugins and function calling, which can enable connecting to external APIs or tools if implemented.

**Deployment & Integration:** Azure OpenAI in GovCloud is delivered as a fully managed service (PaaS). It can be embedded in custom applications or chatbots. For example, Microsoft’s guidelines note it can integrate with an organization’s own data and applications via simple APIs ([Azure OpenAI, including GPT-4o, Approved as a Service within the FedRAMP High Authorization for Azure Government - Azure Government](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-openai-fedramp-high-for-government/#:~:text=GPT,their%20own%20data%20and%20applications)) ([Azure OpenAI, including GPT-4o, Approved as a Service within the FedRAMP High Authorization for Azure Government - Azure Government](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-openai-fedramp-high-for-government/#:~:text=%2A%20Augmented%20Cognition%3A%20Coupling%20GPT,actions%20that%20improve%20mission%20outcomes)). All computation stays in the Azure Gov boundary. Since it’s an Azure service, it inherits Azure’s compliance controls and monitoring.

**Tool Use:** Out-of-the-box, Azure’s service doesn’t include a browser agent, but developers can build one. Microsoft’s **Semantic Kernel** framework (open source) can be used here – it allows creation of “skills” and even multi-agent workflows in .NET/Python ([Microsoft's Agentic AI Frameworks: AutoGen and Semantic Kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/microsofts-agentic-ai-frameworks-autogen-and-semantic-kernel/#:~:text=Microsoft%27s%20Agentic%20AI%20Frameworks%3A%20AutoGen,agent%20solutions.%20Which)). Using Semantic Kernel or custom code, an Azure-hosted agent could call internal APIs, run Azure Functions, or even automate a headless browser (hosted on an isolated VM) through function calling. These custom integrations remain under the agency’s control. (It’s worth noting Microsoft has demonstrated _AutoGen_ and Semantic Kernel agents for multi-step tasks ([Microsoft's Agentic AI Frameworks: AutoGen and Semantic Kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/microsofts-agentic-ai-frameworks-autogen-and-semantic-kernel/#:~:text=Microsoft%27s%20Agentic%20AI%20Frameworks%3A%20AutoGen,agent%20solutions.%20Which)), though these are frameworks rather than a managed product.)

**FedRAMP/Security:** Azure Government cloud and OpenAI service are FedRAMP High and DoD IL4/IL5 authorized ([Azure OpenAI, including GPT-4o, Approved as a Service within the FedRAMP High Authorization for Azure Government - Azure Government](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-openai-fedramp-high-for-government/#:~:text=,High%20and%20DoD%20IL4%2FIL5%20Authorization)). Data is isolated per tenant and **not used for model training** ([Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#:~:text=,available%20exclusively%20for%20your%20use)). This makes it suitable for sensitive data. Organizations must still configure network isolation (e.g. no public internet egress except to known endpoints) if needed and manage access controls to the cognitive search index (to enforce who can query what). Azure’s compliance and the maturity of GPT-4 make this solution highly suitable for enterprise use in government.

### AWS GovCloud – Amazon Bedrock & Kendra

**Overview:** AWS offers multiple building blocks that together fulfill the requirements. **Amazon Bedrock** is AWS’s managed service for foundation models, available in GovCloud with FedRAMP Moderate/High authorization ([AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program — Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/FedRAMP/#:~:text=SERVICES%20%2F%20PROGRAMS%20SDKs%20FedRAMP,Amazon%20Bedrock%20bedrock%20%E2%9C%93%20%E2%9C%93)). Bedrock provides access to models from Anthropic (Claude), AI21, Cohere, Stability, and Amazon’s own (e.g. Titan), all via API. AWS emphasizes data security: “Amazon Bedrock doesn’t store or use your prompts and completions to train any models, nor share them” ([Data protection - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)).

**Semantic Search:** For searching internal data, AWS has **Amazon Kendra**, an AI-powered enterprise search service. Kendra is FedRAMP High authorized in GovCloud ([Amazon Kendra is now FedRAMP High Compliant - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-kendra-fedramp-high-compliant/#:~:text=Amazon%20Kendra%20is%20now%20FedRAMP,search%20service%20powered%20by)) and can index internal document repositories (SharePoint, S3, databases, etc.) with built-in connectors ([Introducing Amazon Kendra GenAI Index – Enhanced semantic search and retrieval capabilities | AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-kendra-genai-index-enhanced-semantic-search-and-retrieval-capabilities/#:~:text=Amazon%20Kendra%20%20is%20an,top%20of%20your%20enterprise%20content)). It uses machine learning to enable semantic query understanding and a hybrid of keyword and vector search. Recently AWS introduced _Kendra GenAI Index_, which combines vector embeddings and keyword search for RAG use cases ([Introducing Amazon Kendra GenAI Index – Enhanced semantic search and retrieval capabilities | AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-kendra-genai-index-enhanced-semantic-search-and-retrieval-capabilities/#:~:text=Amazon%20Kendra%20%20is%20an,top%20of%20your%20enterprise%20content)) ([Introducing Amazon Kendra GenAI Index – Enhanced semantic search and retrieval capabilities | AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-kendra-genai-index-enhanced-semantic-search-and-retrieval-capabilities/#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20Knowledge%20Bases%20provides,across%20their%20generative%20AI%20solutions)). One can use Kendra as the retrieval component and then feed results to an LLM (Bedrock model) to generate a final answer with citations. Alternatively, AWS allows using **pgVector or OpenSearch** for vector search – e.g. an AWS blog demonstrates a FedRAMP-compliant Q&A bot using Postgres+pgvector to store embeddings and Bedrock to generate them and answer questions ([Build a FedRAMP compliant generative AI-powered chatbot using Amazon Aurora Machine Learning and Amazon Bedrock | AWS Database Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/build-a-fedramp-compliant-generative-ai-powered-chatbot-using-amazon-aurora-machine-learning-and-amazon-bedrock/#:~:text=In%20this%20post%2C%20we%20demonstrate,includes%20the%20following%20AWS%20services)) ([Build a FedRAMP compliant generative AI-powered chatbot using Amazon Aurora Machine Learning and Amazon Bedrock | AWS Database Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/build-a-fedramp-compliant-generative-ai-powered-chatbot-using-amazon-aurora-machine-learning-and-amazon-bedrock/#:~:text=The%20solution%20we%20demonstrate%20uses,document%20embeddings%20may%20be%20stored)). In short, AWS provides the tools to perform semantic search over internal data, either via Kendra’s managed index or a DIY vector database.

**Agentic Capabilities:** AWS recently announced **Bedrock Agents** – a managed agent framework on Bedrock. These agents can autonomously break tasks into steps and call APIs or lookup data as needed ([Build Generative AI Applications with Foundation Models - Amazon Bedrock FAQs - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/faqs/#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%C2%A0Agents%20are%20fully%20managed,For)). An AWS agent can “securely connect to company data through an API… augmenting the request with relevant information to generate the most accurate response,” and even _automatically call external APIs to fulfill user requests_ ([Build Generative AI Applications with Foundation Models - Amazon Bedrock FAQs - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/faqs/#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%C2%A0Agents%20are%20fully%20managed,For)). For example, an agent could retrieve data from an internal system via a REST API or even perform an action like updating a record. This covers a portion of the “tool use” requirement (at least for API-based tools). For browser automation, AWS doesn’t supply a built-in Selenium service, but an agent could invoke a Lambda function or AWS Step Function that runs a Puppeteer job on isolated infrastructure if absolutely needed – this would be a custom extension. AWS’s focus is more on API integration than live UI manipulation. Additionally, AWS offers a service called **Amazon Q** (in preview) for a fully managed conversational assistant that hooks into enterprise data and even performs certain task automations like submitting forms ([Introducing Amazon Kendra GenAI Index – Enhanced semantic search and retrieval capabilities | AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-kendra-genai-index-enhanced-semantic-search-and-retrieval-capabilities/#:~:text=Amazon%20Q%20Business%20is%20a,and%20benefits%20help%20desks)) ([Introducing Amazon Kendra GenAI Index – Enhanced semantic search and retrieval capabilities | AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-kendra-genai-index-enhanced-semantic-search-and-retrieval-capabilities/#:~:text=Amazon%20Q%20Business%20also%20helps,seeking%20ways%20to%20get%20RAG)). This hints at growing capabilities for action-taking.

**Deployment:** All these components can reside entirely in AWS GovCloud. Data (documents, indexes, embeddings) can be stored in GovCloud S3 or databases. Bedrock calls occur within the region (with options like AWS PrivateLink to avoid sending traffic over public internet ([Data Protection and Responsible use of Amazon Bedrock in Switzerland | AWS in Switzerland and Austria (Alps)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/alps/security_bedrock/#:~:text=As%20a%20customer%2C%20you%20maintain,of%20the%20Amazon%20Bedrock%20API))). Because AWS allows choice of models, agencies could pick a model that best fits their needs (e.g. Anthropic Claude for longer context or Amazon’s models for cost). Notably, agencies can also bring their own model to Bedrock (Bedrock supports importing custom models like Llama 2) ([Build Generative AI Applications with Foundation Models - Amazon Bedrock FAQs - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/faqs/#:~:text=Can%20I%20train%20a%20model,deploy%20it%20on%20Amazon%20Bedrock)) – which could be useful if an open-source model is fine-tuned on classified data, for instance.

**FedRAMP/Security:** Both Amazon Bedrock and Kendra are **FedRAMP High** in GovCloud ([AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program — Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/FedRAMP/#:~:text=SERVICES%20%2F%20PROGRAMS%20SDKs%20FedRAMP,Amazon%20Bedrock%20bedrock%20%E2%9C%93%20%E2%9C%93)) ([Amazon Kendra is now FedRAMP High Compliant - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-kendra-fedramp-high-compliant/#:~:text=Amazon%20Kendra%20is%20now%20FedRAMP,search%20service%20powered%20by)). AWS’s shared responsibility model applies – AWS secures the infrastructure and base service, while the agency must securely configure the applications (IAM roles, network isolation, encryption, etc.) ([Data protection - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=The%20AWS%20shared%20responsibility%20model,on%20the%20AWS%20Security%20Blog)) ([Data protection - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)). Critically, AWS confirms Bedrock will not use customer content to train models or share it ([Data protection - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)), alleviating data leakage concerns. With proper configuration, this stack can meet rigorous security requirements. One security consideration is that if the agent calls external APIs or websites, those calls should be monitored – e.g. restrict it to call only whitelisted external endpoints to prevent any accidental data exfiltration in queries.

### IBM Watson Discovery / watsonx

**Overview:** IBM offers enterprise AI platforms that can be deployed in private environments, which is beneficial for FedRAMP compliance. **Watson Discovery** is an intelligent search and text analytics platform that supports semantic search over enterprise data. It can ingest documents, perform NLP-driven indexing, and allow natural language queries. IBM’s newer **watsonx** suite includes foundation models and a question-answering system that can be hosted on IBM Cloud or on-prem via IBM Cloud Pak for Data. IBM has experience with government deployments and supports data isolation by design. For instance, **Watson (Premium)** deployments ensure no customer data is used to improve IBM’s models by default ([](https://www.ibm.com/watson/assets/duo/pdf/Watson-Privacy-and-Security-POV_final_062819_tps.pdf#:~:text=POV%20%E2%80%93%20Watson%20Privacy%2C%20Compliance%2C,data%20is%20used%20for%20the)). IBM allows clients to opt-out of any data sharing even in standard cloud deployments ([](https://www.ibm.com/watson/assets/duo/pdf/Watson-Privacy-and-Security-POV_final_062819_tps.pdf#:~:text=POV%20%E2%80%93%20Watson%20Privacy%2C%20Compliance%2C,data%20is%20used%20for%20the)).

**Semantic Search:** Watson Discovery provides out-of-the-box semantic search and even **extractive question answering** from documents. It creates embeddings and uses deep learning under the hood (IBM had a “Natural Language Query” feature). With watsonx, IBM introduced its own foundation models (e.g. Granite series) which can be used to generate embeddings or answers. These can be fine-tuned on private data and deployed within a secure cluster. IBM’s approach often blends knowledge retrieval with NLP – for example, you can ask Discovery a question and it will find the answer paragraph from your docs. While IBM’s models historically were less powerful than OpenAI’s, they are improving and importantly can be run in a fully isolated manner. IBM also supports integration of OpenAI or other models in their platform if desired, with governance around it.

**Tool/Agent Capabilities:** IBM’s platform is more focused on search and chatbot functions rather than autonomous multi-step agents. However, IBM has adjacent offerings (and partners) for RPA and process automation. An “agentic” solution could be built by linking Watson Assistant (IBM’s chatbot builder) with RPA bots (like IBM Robotic Process Automation or third-party RPA) to execute tasks. IBM’s literature on Agentic AI suggests recognizing the importance of tool use – IBM defines agentic AI as systems that can “design their workflow and use available tools” to act autonomously ([Agentic AI: 4 reasons why it’s the next big thing in AI research | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/agentic-ai#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%20refers%20to%20a,ML%29%C2%A0models%20were%20trained)). In practice, implementing this might require custom development on IBM’s platform, since it’s not as straightforward as in open frameworks. That said, IBM’s strong integration with enterprise systems (e.g. Maximo, ERP systems, etc.) means an AI assistant built on IBM can invoke APIs of those systems with proper configuration.

**Deployment:** IBM Cloud offers a FedRAMP Moderate environment for some services ([IBM Cloud FedRAMP compliance](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/fedramp#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Risk%20and%20Authorization,security%20of%20cloud%20computing)), but many government customers use **IBM Cloud Pak for Data** to deploy Watson services on their own infrastructure (e.g. on Red Hat OpenShift in AWS GovCloud or on-prem). Cloud Pak for Data is essentially a containerized set of IBM data/AI services that an organization controls – this ensures all data stays within the accredited boundary. With this model, an agency could run Watson Discovery and even Watson Assistant entirely in-house, meeting FedRAMP through their own ATO process (as the system would sit on FedRAMP IaaS). IBM also supports compliance regimes like HIPAA, DoD SRG, etc., which indicates strong security focus, though FedRAMP High authorization for Watson services themselves isn’t publicly noted (agencies likely handle it via self-hosting).

**FedRAMP/Security:** Using IBM’s solution in a FedRAMP context typically means either IBM’s FedRAMP-certified cloud for Government (for base infrastructure) or self-hosting with proper controls. IBM emphasizes “your data is your data” and provides features to ensure no inadvertent data sharing ([](https://www.ibm.com/watson/assets/duo/pdf/Watson-Privacy-and-Security-POV_final_062819_tps.pdf#:~:text=POV%20%E2%80%93%20Watson%20Privacy%2C%20Compliance%2C,data%20is%20used%20for%20the)). For example, if using Watson Discovery on IBM Cloud, one can request that no data be used to update IBM’s models ([](https://www.ibm.com/watson/assets/duo/pdf/Watson-Privacy-and-Security-POV_final_062819_tps.pdf#:~:text=POV%20%E2%80%93%20Watson%20Privacy%2C%20Compliance%2C,data%20is%20used%20for%20the)). In a private deployment, that risk is eliminated entirely. IBM has a long track record with government clients, so it has support for required security controls (encryption, audit logging, access control, etc.). One should ensure that any model fine-tuning is done on hardware they control and that no connections to IBM or third-party are sending the training data (unless explicitly intended). Overall, IBM’s platforms are well-suited for agencies that need a **mature, controlled environment** and are willing to trade some bleeding-edge model capability for out-of-the-box compliance and data governance.

### Palantir Foundry + AIP

**Overview:** Palantir’s Foundry is an end-to-end data analytics platform widely used in government (FedRAMP High authorized for Palantir Federal Cloud ([Palantir Granted FedRAMP High Baseline Authorization](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2024/Palantir-Granted-FedRAMP-High-Baseline-Authorization/#:~:text=Authorization%20investors,PFCS))). In 2023, Palantir introduced its **Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP)** as an add-on, which integrates LLMs and agentic capabilities into Foundry ([Palantir Foundry AIP - Unit8](https://unit8.com/resources/palantir-foundry-aip/#:~:text=In%20April%202023%2C%20the%20company,and%20functionalities%20since%20its%20inception)). Palantir AIP is specifically designed to let organizations harness LLMs on their private data **with strict control** – it “integrates large language models into privately operated networks” ([Palantir Foundry AIP - Unit8](https://unit8.com/resources/palantir-foundry-aip/#:~:text=In%20April%202023%2C%20the%20company,and%20functionalities%20since%20its%20inception)), meaning the model can interact with sensitive data without that data leaving the secure environment. Palantir often emphasizes that AIP enables usage of LLMs while enforcing compliance (it can log all prompts, redact secrets from prompts, control what data the LLM sees, etc. as per policies).

**Capabilities:** Palantir AIP provides a secure interface for LLMs to query your data and even take actions in other systems under governance. For instance, a government agency could use AIP to ask an AI agent to summarize intel reports or find connections in databases, and because it’s Palantir, the agent can leverage the platform’s ontology and access control – it only sees data the user is permitted to see, and all actions are permissioned. AIP also allows the AI to execute “approved” functions: e.g. trigger workflows, send recommendations, or update data, with a human approval step if required ([How Palantir AIP Enables UNS for Industry AI](https://blog.palantir.com/industry-ai-8cd003a81be1#:~:text=Palantir%20AIP%20introduces%20a%20sophisticated,making)). This is quite aligned with an _“agentic”_ paradigm but with guardrails.

Palantir has demonstrated advanced reasoning use cases (like helping military planners by analyzing logistics data and asking follow-up questions). Since Palantir doesn’t develop its own LLM, AIP interfaces with models like GPT-4, Llama 2, etc., which can be hosted in the secure environment (Palantir can deploy models within its FedCloud or hook to Azure OpenAI). The key value Palantir adds is the orchestration logic, compliance (every interaction is auditable), and integration to existing data silos.

**Deployment:** Palantir Foundry with AIP can be deployed in various ways. Palantir’s FedCloud (a FedRAMP High cloud environment run by Palantir) can host it as a SaaS for a customer, or it can be deployed into an agency’s own cloud environment via Palantir’s FedStart program ([Palantir FedStart](https://www.palantir.com/offerings/fedstart/#:~:text=Palantir%20FedStart%20Palantir%20FedStart%20is,software%20to%20the%20federal%20government)). Either way, it meets high-impact security requirements. All proprietary data stays within the accredited boundary – the LLM is brought to the data, not vice-versa.

**FedRAMP/Security:** Palantir’s cloud is FedRAMP High and even IL5/6 for classified. They have extremely robust access controls and segmentation in place (originally built for intelligence community). AIP ensures no prompts or data are sent to external services unless explicitly configured. In fact, one selling point is that _“no data will be used to train models”_ and organizations can even use **their own models** if they prefer (to avoid any external model IP concerns). Given Palantir’s focus on audit and compliance, this solution is one of the most **secure for enterprise/Gov** — at the cost of vendor lock-in and expense. It’s best suited if an agency already uses Palantir for data management or has the scale to justify it. For those who do, AIP provides a powerful agentic AI that can reason over internal data and execute tasks with guardrails, all in a FedRAMP-compliant manner.

### Other Enterprise Platforms and Emerging Solutions

Beyond the big cloud providers and Palantir, a few other notable solutions align with these requirements:

- **C3 AI Generative AI:** C3.ai (an enterprise AI software firm) has launched a **“C3 Generative AI for Government”** application ([C3 AI Launches C3 Generative AI for Government Programs Application with Google Cloud](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-launches-c3-generative-ai-for-government-programs-application-with-google-cloud/#:~:text=REDWOOD%20CITY%2C%20Calif,systems%20and%20services%20with%20ease)). It is essentially an AI assistant focused on querying complex government data (e.g., helping citizens or analysts navigate healthcare, finance programs, etc.). C3.ai’s platform achieved FedRAMP Ready status ([C3 AI Suite Achieves FedRAMP Ready Status](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-suite-achieves-fedramp-ready-status/#:~:text=C3%20AI%20Suite%20Achieves%20FedRAMP,This%20designation)), and the Generative AI app touts “robust enterprise-level security, access controls, and full traceability” ([C3 AI Launches C3 Generative AI for Government Programs Application with Google Cloud](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-launches-c3-generative-ai-for-government-programs-application-with-google-cloud/#:~:text=C3%20Generative%20AI%20is%20an,access%20controls%2C%20and%20full%20traceability)). It provides an intuitive search/chat interface with citations to sources, similar to a RAG approach ([C3 AI Launches C3 Generative AI for Government Programs Application with Google Cloud](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-launches-c3-generative-ai-for-government-programs-application-with-google-cloud/#:~:text=C3%20Generative%20AI%20is%20an,access%20controls%2C%20and%20full%20traceability)). C3.ai likely hosts this on a government cloud (they partnered with Google Cloud in the announcement ([C3 AI Launches C3 Generative AI for Government Programs Application with Google Cloud](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-launches-c3-generative-ai-for-government-programs-application-with-google-cloud/#:~:text=C3%20AI%20Launches%20C3%20Generative,Programs%20Application%20with%20Google%20Cloud)) but could deploy on others). While not as agentic (it’s mainly a Q&A interface), it’s designed for government use and can be deployed within a compliant environment. Agencies looking for a turnkey Q&A solution with FedRAMP compliance might consider this.

- **Moveworks Enterprise Search:** Moveworks, known for enterprise chatbots, introduced an _Agentic AI_ based enterprise search that is “dynamic, goal-oriented, and intelligent” in how it searches across company systems ([Moveworks Introduces Enterprise Search with Agentic AI and Enhances RAG with Reasoning | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/company/news/press-releases/moveworks-introduces-enterprise-search-with-agentic-ai-and-Enhances-rag-with-reasoning#:~:text=Moveworks%20solves%20this%20with%20a,quality%20results)). It uses a **Reasoning Engine** to plan multi-step retrieval – essentially an agent that figures out which systems to query and how. Moveworks focuses on employee support (IT, HR knowledge). While Moveworks is a SaaS offering (multi-tenant cloud), they emphasize security and have some large enterprise deployments. However, without a FedRAMP authorization, it would be challenging to use in a federal agency except maybe in low-risk use cases. The concept is noteworthy: Moveworks’ agent can take a user query, determine which internal knowledge base or database to search, gather info, and present an answer with citations, all while respecting permissions ([Moveworks Introduces Enterprise Search with Agentic AI and Enhances RAG with Reasoning | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/company/news/press-releases/moveworks-introduces-enterprise-search-with-agentic-ai-and-Enhances-rag-with-reasoning#:~:text=Moveworks%20solves%20this%20with%20a,quality%20results)). It represents how _agentic search_ can improve accuracy and avoid hallucinations by critically verifying information.

- **SearchUnify, Glean, etc.:** These are enterprise search platforms that now incorporate generative AI. **SearchUnify** advertises “Agentic AI” for enterprise search ([Agentic AI: The Next Big Thing Transforming Enterprise Search](https://www.searchunify.com/blog/from-genai-to-agentic-ai-how-enterprise-search-landscape-is-evolving/#:~:text=Agentic%20AI%3A%20The%20Next%20Big,making%20power)) ([SearchUnify Enterprise Search | Fueled by Agentic AI](https://www.searchunify.com/solutions/enterprise-search/#:~:text=SearchUnify%20Enterprise%20Search%20,scalable%20search%20across%20diverse%20content)), likely meaning their search can call external LLMs and tools. **Glean** is another modern enterprise search that connects to many SaaS apps for unified search; they have introduced a conversational AI on top of it. Both focus on internal data and could technically be deployed in a single-tenant mode for an enterprise. But like Moveworks, unless they pursue FedRAMP or allow a private cloud deployment, their use in Fed environments might be limited. They do illustrate the trend of _autonomous search assistants_ becoming common.

- **Vectara:** Vectara is a cloud service for neural search and generative QA. Notably, Vectara from the start has a strict data privacy pledge: _“we never train our models on customer data”_ ([Security at Vectara](https://www.vectara.com/legal/security-at-vectara#:~:text=Vectara%20bakes%20security%20and%20trust,GenAI%20security%20and%20compliance%20goals)) and they implement RAG so that generation is based on your data retrieved, not memorized content ([Security at Vectara](https://www.vectara.com/legal/security-at-vectara#:~:text=Privacy%20and%20Model%20Training)). They have numerous compliance certifications ([Security at Vectara](https://www.vectara.com/legal/security-at-vectara#:~:text=Vectara%20is%20SOC,0%20certified)) and claim their hosting infrastructure meets FedRAMP among others (likely through AWS/GCP compliance). While Vectara offers a compelling semantic search API, using it in a FedRAMP context would likely require a dedicated instance or at least a Gov region deployment (which is not publicly announced). If that were arranged, Vectara could serve as a vector database + LLM service where the agency’s data is isolated and not learned by the model. As of now, it remains more of a commercial SaaS option with strong privacy but not FedRAMP authorized.

In summary, several enterprise-focused AI products exist, each with some subset of the required capabilities. Azure and AWS provide the core ingredients as cloud services, IBM and Palantir provide integrated platforms with data governance, and newer players like C3, Moveworks, and Vectara push the envelope in agentic semantic search (though with potential compliance gaps to address). Next, we consider open-source approaches which can be highly tailored for FedRAMP environments.

## Open-Source and Custom-Built Solutions

For maximum control and isolation, organizations can turn to open-source frameworks to build a bespoke research agent. This approach requires more engineering effort but can be made fully compliant since everything runs in your own environment.

**LLM Orchestration Frameworks:** Tools like **LangChain**, **Haystack (deepset)**, and **LlamaIndex** are popular frameworks for Retrieval-Augmented Generation and agent development ([Do we need LangChain, LlamaIndex and Haystack, and are AI ...](https://medium.com/@jlchereau/do-we-still-need-langchain-llamaindex-and-haystack-and-are-ai-agents-dead-522c77bed94e#:~:text=LangChain%2C%20LLamaIndex%20and%20Haystack%20are,RAG%29%20applications)) ([LangChain Alternatives | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/langchain-alternatives#:~:text=LangChain%20Alternatives%20,tools%2C%20chatbots%20and%20RAG)). They provide abstractions to connect an LLM with various data sources and tools. For example, with LangChain one can: load internal documents, create embeddings (using either open-source models or calls to a local GPU/accelerator), store them in a vector database, and then define an Agent that uses a Large Language Model to answer questions or perform tasks using those tools. LangChain supports integration with web browsing (via an HTTP wrapper or Selenium), with OS commands, and more. Haystack similarly allows pipelines for document search and QA, and has an `Agents` module to incorporate tools. These frameworks are essentially the _glue_ to assemble an agentic system fulfilling all key capabilities.

- _Semantic Search Component:_ Using open source, you can choose a vector database (e.g. **FAISS**, **Qdrant**, **Milvus**, or even Postgres pgvector) to index internal data. For embeddings, you might use a local model (such as sentence-transformers or Llama 2 embeddings) or call an external embedding API if allowed. Many agencies prefer local models for embeddings to avoid external calls. There are high-quality open embeddings like **InstructorXL** or **MPNet** that can be deployed. The retrieved documents are then fed into the LLM for context.
- _LLM Choices:_ For strict isolation, an open-source model can be deployed on-premise. **Llama 2** (70B) is a leading candidate that can be run (potentially fine-tuned for better instruction following). Other models like **Falcon**, **MPT-30B**, or **FLAN-T5** could be used depending on needs. While these models may not match GPT-4’s full capability, they can handle a lot of queries especially when augmented with relevant context. Notably, agencies could also use commercial model APIs through GovCloud (e.g. via Bedrock or Azure OpenAI as discussed) within a LangChain pipeline – this hybrid approach still keeps orchestration and data handling in-house while using a powerful model behind the scenes.
- _Tool Integration:_ LangChain and similar frameworks support “tools” which can be anything from a Google search API call to a Python function. In a FedRAMP environment, you might configure tools for **internal** APIs (e.g. an API to query an internal database or an RSS feed of a private news source) and for **web browsing** of public info (if allowed by policy). For web browsing, a secure approach is to use a headless browser controlled via Python (Selenium or Playwright) so that the agent can navigate JavaScript-heavy sites or log into pages if credentials are provided. There have been experiments like _Chrome-GPT_ that integrate AutoGPT with Selenium to control Chrome ([richardyc/Chrome-GPT: An AutoGPT agent that controls ... - GitHub](https://github.com/richardyc/Chrome-GPT#:~:text=richardyc%2FChrome,of%20an%20entire%20Chrome%20session)). Using such techniques, one could enable an agent to, say, log into an internal web portal and scrape data. OS-level actions (like reading local files, executing shell commands) can be enabled in a controlled sandbox as tools. Obviously, with great power comes risk – one must sandbox what the agent can do to prevent accidental harmful actions on the system. But the flexibility is there: you could let the agent run data analysis Python scripts, trigger workflows, or compile reports autonomously.
- _Reasoning Abilities:_ The open-source route allows use of the latest research on prompting and agent reasoning. Frameworks can implement **ReAct style** agents (which interweave reasoning and acting). Developers can also tune the chain-of-thought via system prompts or use techniques like self-consistency. While a raw open model might not be as consistent as GPT-4, giving it tools and carefully engineered prompts (or fine-tuning it on domain-specific reasoning tasks) can yield strong performance. Also, one can incorporate **verification steps** – for example, after the LLM drafts an answer, run a fact-check tool or cross-verify with the source text, to minimize hallucinations. All of this is customizable.

**Deployment:** All components (the LLM, vector store, and any tool backends) would reside in the agency’s secure cloud or data center. This approach can be deployed to AWS GovCloud or Azure Gov as well, but using only IaaS (VMs, containers, etc.) that the agency manages. That means the agency’s team is responsible for implementing security controls (locking down networks, applying OS patches, access control, monitoring logs). From a FedRAMP perspective, if this is an internal system, it would go through the agency’s **ATO process** as a custom application on a FedRAMP-approved infrastructure service. The advantage is there’s zero dependency on external services at runtime – thus no risk of data leakage beyond the boundary by design.

**Security Considerations:** When building in-house, one must ensure the solution itself complies with security requirements: use FIPS 140-2 encryption for data at rest and in transit, enforce least privilege (e.g. if the agent needs to call a sensitive database, ensure it only has read access needed for its purpose), and implement audit logging for the agent’s actions (so you have a record of what it accessed or did – important for trust). Rate limiting and guardrails on tool use are wise; for instance, prevent the agent from making unlimited external web requests or from executing certain system commands. Essentially, the open-source approach gives maximum security **configurability** – you can turn every knob – but it puts the onus on the enterprise to do it right.

**FedRAMP Compliance:** While you can’t get an “open-source LangChain” FedRAMP certified (FedRAMP doesn’t certify custom code, only cloud services), you ensure compliance by running on FedRAMP-certified infrastructure and implementing the NIST controls in your deployment. Many agencies have done similar things for custom AI solutions: the system is assessed by security officials and granted an Authority to Operate. Because all data remains internal and you have full code transparency (open source = no hidden behaviors), this approach can satisfy even the most stringent requirements (indeed, it may be the only route for classified environments where no external model access is allowed). The trade-off is engineering effort and possibly somewhat lower accuracy or capability compared to the best proprietary models – though this gap can be mitigated by careful system design and the rapidly improving open models.

## Security and FedRAMP Implications

When evaluating these platforms, a few cross-cutting security and compliance points emerge:

- **Data Residency & Isolation:** It’s imperative that the chosen solution keeps all sensitive data within approved boundaries. Azure and AWS clearly meet this by offering region-isolated services in Gov clouds. Other COTS vendors must either host a separate instance for government (Palantir, IBM, C3 do this) or be deployable in a private enclave. Any solution that calls out to a public API (e.g. to OpenAI’s public endpoint or to an uncontrolled website) risks transmitting sensitive info. Techniques like prompt scrubbing (removing PII or classified terms from queries) might be needed if any external calls are made. Generally, for FedRAMP High, one would avoid external calls entirely or use only pre-approved external data sources.

- **No Training on Customer Data:** A strict requirement by many enterprises (and now formally by EU laws) is that the AI provider not use your inputs to improve their models. All the leading platforms addressed this: Azure OpenAI explicitly guarantees no customer data leaves or trains the model ([Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#:~:text=,available%20exclusively%20for%20your%20use)), AWS Bedrock likewise ([Data protection - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)), IBM allows opting out (and in premium tiers never does it) ([](https://www.ibm.com/watson/assets/duo/pdf/Watson-Privacy-and-Security-POV_final_062819_tps.pdf#:~:text=POV%20%E2%80%93%20Watson%20Privacy%2C%20Compliance%2C,data%20is%20used%20for%20the)), Palantir and open-source by design won’t unless you configure it to. This is important for protecting proprietary or citizen data. It also has a side benefit: it prevents unintended data exposure through the AI’s future outputs. (If an AI is training on your data, there’s a risk that pieces of that data could surface in responses to another user later – which must not happen in multi-tenant scenarios.) All solutions we’ve highlighted respect this isolation, but it’s always good to **get it in writing** in contracts or documentation. For instance, any contract with a SaaS AI vendor should have language mirroring “your prompts and data will not be used to improve the service for others” – much like Microsoft and AWS documentation states ([Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#:~:text=,available%20exclusively%20for%20your%20use)) ([Data protection - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)).

- **FedRAMP Authorization Level:** Depending on agency needs, FedRAMP Moderate might suffice (for less sensitive data) whereas others require High. Azure OpenAI and AWS GovCloud services are High. Some newer services might still be Moderate while undergoing High (FedRAMP Marketplace listings can confirm the official status). Using a service _within_ an already authorized environment (like an AWS Gov region) generally simplifies compliance versus using an external SaaS. If considering a less traditional vendor (e.g. Moveworks or Vectara), check if they have FedRAMP Moderate at least or if an agency sponsor is willing to do an ATO. Without that, it may be a non-starter for production use.

- **Identity and Access Management:** Enterprise use means controlling who can use the agent and what data it can access. Platforms like Kendra, Watson, and Palantir support fine-grained permissions – the agent will only show results a given user is allowed to see (Kendra, for example, can enforce document-level ACLs ([Introducing Amazon Kendra GenAI Index – Enhanced semantic search and retrieval capabilities | AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-kendra-genai-index-enhanced-semantic-search-and-retrieval-capabilities/#:~:text=Entities%20also%20come%20with%20access,for%20their%20generative%20AI%20solutions)) ([Introducing Amazon Kendra GenAI Index – Enhanced semantic search and retrieval capabilities | AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-kendra-genai-index-enhanced-semantic-search-and-retrieval-capabilities/#:~:text=Amazon%20Q%20Business%20is%20a,and%20benefits%20help%20desks))). For a custom solution, implementing such guardrails is vital: e.g. integrate with the agency’s Single Sign-On and pass the user’s identity to the search component to filter results. This prevents data leakage between departments or roles. FedRAMP solutions typically integrate with identity providers and log all access for auditing.

- **Auditing and Logging:** Any action the agent takes (search query, external API call, etc.) should be logged. In regulated environments, this is key for accountability. Palantir AIP, for instance, was built with a “digital trail” of all AI decisions. Even an open-source agent can log its chain-of-thought and tool usage (LangChain has callbacks for this). These logs should be stored securely and monitored for any anomalies (like the agent trying to access disallowed resources, which might indicate a prompt injection attempt). FedRAMP requires continuous monitoring; ensuring the AI system’s activities are part of that will be expected.

- **Model Alignment and Content Filtering:** From a security perspective, one must also consider the AI’s _outputs_. Models should be aligned to avoid leaking sensitive info or generating disallowed content (hate speech, etc.). Azure and AWS have built-in content filters and allow customizing them. Open source models might require implementing a moderation layer – e.g. using an open-source filter or keywords to post-process the LLM output. In government settings, prompts might also be adversarial (malicious user input), so having the agent verify before executing a potentially dangerous tool command is necessary (some frameworks let you impose confirmations or use smaller “guard” models to evaluate requests).

- **Maintenance and Updates:** In a fast-moving AI field, models and vulnerabilities are discovered regularly. COTS solutions will handle model updates (and critical patches) for you; for instance, if OpenAI improves GPT-4 or fixes a bug, Azure will roll it out. In contrast, if you self-host a model, you need to track updates or improvements (like new finetunes or guardrails) and apply them. This is a consideration in long-term suitability – enterprise teams might prefer a managed service to reduce maintenance burden, provided it meets compliance.

- **Cost vs. Value:** Finally, a pragmatic note: advanced agentic AI can be resource-intensive. Running GPT-4-level models in the cloud costs money; running open 70B models in-house requires expensive GPU infrastructure. COTS solutions often charge per 1K tokens or per query (Azure/AWS), which can add up but are scalable. Open-source gives flexibility to optimize costs (like distilling a model or using cheaper hardware for smaller models when possible). The **value-added features** like browser automation or complex reasoning should justify the cost by significantly boosting productivity or insights. In use, one might find only certain use cases truly need full agent autonomy, while others could be solved with simpler QA bots. It’s wise to match the solution’s level of “agentic intelligence” to the problem at hand – and many platforms allow dialing it up or down. For example, Moveworks found basic RAG often wasn’t enough due to hallucinations, hence their agentic approach to verify sources ([Moveworks Introduces Enterprise Search with Agentic AI and Enhances RAG with Reasoning | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/company/news/press-releases/moveworks-introduces-enterprise-search-with-agentic-ai-and-Enhances-rag-with-reasoning#:~:text=The%20arrival%20of%20Retrieval%20Augmented,beyond%20basic%2C%20homegrown%20RAG%20solutions)). Each added capability (and its complexity) should address a clear pain point.

## Comparison of Leading Platforms

To summarize the leading options and their fit for a FedRAMP enterprise scenario:

- **Azure OpenAI (Gov)** – _Strengths:_ Best-in-class LLM (GPT-4) with full FedRAMP High compliance ([Azure OpenAI, including GPT-4o, Approved as a Service within the FedRAMP High Authorization for Azure Government - Azure Government](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-openai-fedramp-high-for-government/#:~:text=,High%20and%20DoD%20IL4%2FIL5%20Authorization)). No data leakage ([Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#:~:text=,available%20exclusively%20for%20your%20use)). Easily integrates with Azure data services for semantic search. Mature and supported by Microsoft. _Limitations:_ Out-of-the-box agent/tool use is manual to set up (requires developer to use function calling or Semantic Kernel). Tied to Azure ecosystem. Costs can be significant for heavy use, but you pay per use.

- **AWS Bedrock + Kendra** – _Strengths:_ Very flexible: choice of multiple models (including future Anthropic, Stability, etc.), and powerful search/indexing via Kendra ([Introducing Amazon Kendra GenAI Index – Enhanced semantic search and retrieval capabilities | AWS Machine Learning Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-kendra-genai-index-enhanced-semantic-search-and-retrieval-capabilities/#:~:text=Amazon%20Kendra%20%20is%20an,top%20of%20your%20enterprise%20content)). FedRAMP High in GovCloud ([AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program — Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/FedRAMP/#:~:text=SERVICES%20%2F%20PROGRAMS%20SDKs%20FedRAMP,Amazon%20Bedrock%20bedrock%20%E2%9C%93%20%E2%9C%93)), with strict no-training guarantees ([Data protection - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)). Can compose many AWS services (Lambda, etc.) to extend functionality, and new Bedrock Agents feature natively supports API calls ([Build Generative AI Applications with Foundation Models - Amazon Bedrock FAQs - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/faqs/#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%C2%A0Agents%20are%20fully%20managed,For)). _Limitations:_ Not a single product but a collection of services – requires solution architecture. LLM quality depends on chosen model (Claude 2, for instance, is very good; Amazon’s own model is decent but not GPT-4 level). Implementing a browser automation would be custom (AWS focuses on APIs).

- **IBM Watsonx/Discovery** – _Strengths:_ Enterprise-grade solution with strong data governance. Deployable in fully private mode (Cloud Pak) – data stays in-house. Has built-in semantic search and some NLP capabilities; can integrate an organization’s structured and unstructured data. IBM’s long experience with enterprise AI and support for compliance is a plus. _Limitations:_ The LLMs available may be less powerful; for cutting-edge reasoning, one might integrate a 3rd party model. Less “autonomous agent” capability out-of-box – more geared to assisting a human or answering queries than executing multi-step tasks automatically. Heavier footprint (often requires an OpenShift/Kubernetes environment).

- **Palantir AIP** – _Strengths:_ Unmatched for high-security integration of AI. Policy controls, auditing, and complex tool integration (with the organization’s databases, workflows) are built-in. Suitable for mission-critical, multi-agent orchestration with humans in the loop. Already FedRAMP High ([Palantir Granted FedRAMP High Baseline Authorization](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2024/Palantir-Granted-FedRAMP-High-Baseline-Authorization/#:~:text=Authorization%20investors,PFCS)) and even cleared for classified data in some cases. _Limitations:_ Very costly and requires Palantir expertise to implement. You are tied to the Palantir ecosystem (which for some is fine, for others not). Model choices might be constrained to what Palantir supports (likely the big ones, but still an extra dependency).

- **C3 Generative AI** – _Strengths:_ Turnkey application for a specific need (answering public’s questions on programs, etc.) with strong security focus ([C3 AI Launches C3 Generative AI for Government Programs Application with Google Cloud](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-launches-c3-generative-ai-for-government-programs-application-with-google-cloud/#:~:text=C3%20Generative%20AI%20is%20an,access%20controls%2C%20and%20full%20traceability)). Could be valuable for agencies needing a conversational portal quickly. Backed by C3’s FedRAMP-ready platform. _Limitations:_ It’s not a general research agent for analysts; more of a niche Q&A assistant. If your use case matches it, great – if not, it may require significant customization or not be applicable. Also, being relatively new, it’s unproven at scale compared to Azure/AWS solutions.

- **Open-Source Custom (LangChain + LLM)** – _Strengths:_ Full control over data and code. Can be tailored to exactly your use case (mix and match tools, custom logic). No external dependency = strong isolation (especially for classified or highly sensitive data). Avoids vendor lock-in and can be cost-efficient at scale (one-time infra investment vs ongoing API costs). _Limitations:_ Requires skilled development team to build and maintain. Model performance might lag behind state-of-the-art unless you use a provider’s API at times. More components to secure and update. Essentially, you become the integrator and operator of the system, which not every enterprise is ready to do.

In an **enterprise FedRAMP environment**, many organizations opt for a hybrid of these solutions. For example, one might use Azure or AWS’s FedRAMP services for the core LLM and vector search (leveraging their compliance coverage and quality models), but still build custom logic and perhaps an internal orchestration (using open-source frameworks) to implement the “agent” behavior and tool integrations needed. This way you get the best of both: a controlled, high-performing model and a custom agent that lives in your environment coordinating the research workflow.

## Conclusion

Agentic AI platforms capable of deep research are on the cutting edge of enterprise technology, and deploying them in government settings is now feasible with careful selection and architecture. Both major cloud providers have FedRAMP-approved offerings that check most boxes – with Azure and AWS you can achieve semantic search on internal data and even some level of tool use within a secure cloud, all while keeping data private ([Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service - Azure AI services | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy#:~:text=,available%20exclusively%20for%20your%20use)) ([Data protection - Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/data-protection.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Bedrock%20doesn%27t%20store%20or,distribute%20them%20to%20third%20parties)). Traditional players like IBM and Palantir provide more all-in-one environments emphasizing compliance and integration at the expense of some flexibility. Emerging vendors bring innovative “research agent” features (reasoning engines, etc. ([Moveworks Introduces Enterprise Search with Agentic AI and Enhances RAG with Reasoning | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/company/news/press-releases/moveworks-introduces-enterprise-search-with-agentic-ai-and-Enhances-rag-with-reasoning#:~:text=Moveworks%20solves%20this%20with%20a,quality%20results))), but one must vet their security posture for government use.

Ultimately, the “best” solution depends on the agency’s priorities:

- If **fastest time-to-value with minimal development** is key, a managed service like Azure OpenAI or a packaged solution like C3 AI’s app might be ideal.
- If **maximal security and customization** is needed (e.g. defense intel use case), an in-house deployment with open-source tools or Palantir AIP might be warranted.
- For a balanced approach, using cloud FedRAMP services for the heavy AI lifting combined with custom middleware for orchestration can strike a good middle ground.

All options require due diligence in terms of FedRAMP paperwork, contractual SLAs, and ongoing monitoring. But the encouraging news is that multiple platforms now allow government agencies to harness state-of-the-art **semantic search and agentic reasoning** without compromising on security or data sovereignty. By carefully evaluating the trade-offs outlined above, enterprises can select a platform that delivers powerful “deep research” capabilities while operating wholly within their secure cloud environment – ensuring compliance with FedRAMP and safeguarding their proprietary data at every step.

### Scope of Commercial Offerings: Are you primarily looking for existing COTS solutions that provide both deep research capabilities and an AI co-pilot for in-line text editing, or would you also consider highly customizable frameworks (e.g., LangChain + LLMs) that require some development effort?

A: we are not interested in highly customizable frameworks, it is well understood that we could stitch together a bespoke solution using these tools

### Deployment Preference: Do you need solutions that are explicitly FedRAMP High authorized, or are solutions that can be self-hosted in a FedRAMP-compliant cloud (like AWS GovCloud or Azure Gov) also acceptable?

A: FedRamp is a must have, we will consider solutions that are not yet FedRamp authorized but are likely to become FedRamp authorized in the future

### Integration with Private External Data: Do you have specific private third-party data providers (e.g., Gartner, Forrester) that you need integration with, or should the research focus on platforms that offer configurable API access to such sources?

A: Gartner is just obvious, and solutions that could query Gartner could probably query similar offerings from other entities

### Agent Capabilities: Should the AI agent only retrieve and synthesize data, or should it also be capable of executing certain actions (e.g., scheduling reports, automating simple workflows)?

A; Consider as separate feature sets. Our primary concern is the ability to retrieve and synthesize data, ability for the agents to perform tangible actions such as send and receive email, speak on behalf of people, trigger workflows, generally act as a human are value adds.

### Collaboration Features: Are you looking for a real-time co-editing experience similar to Google Docs, or more of an AI-assisted document review where the copilot suggests inline edits but doesn’t allow direct co-editing?

A: Co-editing is a must have

## Research

Commercially available (COTS) solutions that provide deep research capabilities and an AI co-pilot for in-line text editing, with a focus on solutions that are already FedRAMP High authorized or are on the path to authorization. The research will also identify solutions with the ability to query private external data sources like Gartner, integrate real-time co-editing features, and potentially support advanced agentic capabilities such as executing workflows or interacting autonomously on behalf of users.

Understood. I will research commercially available (COTS) solutions that provide deep research capabilities and an AI co-pilot for in-line text editing, with a focus on solutions that are already FedRAMP High authorized or are on the path to authorization. The research will also identify solutions with the ability to query private external data sources like Gartner, integrate real-time co-editing features, and potentially support advanced agentic capabilities such as executing workflows or interacting autonomously on behalf of users.

I'll get back to you with a detailed analysis of available solutions.

# Comparative Analysis of AI Co-Pilot Solutions for Deep Research

This analysis compares commercially available AI "co-pilot" solutions that combine deep research capabilities with in-line text editing and collaboration. Each solution is evaluated against key criteria: **FedRAMP compliance**, **real-time collaborative editing**, **data integration (internal, third-party, and web)**, and **agentic capabilities** (the ability to not only synthesize information but also perform actions). Security, data isolation, and compliance considerations are highlighted for each.

## Microsoft 365 Copilot (Microsoft)

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: Microsoft’s AI co-pilot for Office (Word, Excel, Teams, etc.) is on track for government use. The Azure OpenAI Service (which underpins Copilot) achieved **FedRAMP High** authorization in Azure Government in 2024 ([Azure OpenAI FedRAMP High + Microsoft 365 Copilot Targeting GA for GCC High and DOD by September 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft365copilot/azure-openai-fedramp-high--m365-copilot-targeting-sept-2025-for-gcc-highdod/4223788#:~:text=1,within%20their%20Azure%20Government%20environment)). Microsoft 365 Copilot is targeting general availability in **GCC High and DoD** (government cloud) by Summer 2025, pending U.S. government authorization ([Azure OpenAI FedRAMP High + Microsoft 365 Copilot Targeting GA for GCC High and DOD by September 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft365copilot/azure-openai-fedramp-high--m365-copilot-targeting-sept-2025-for-gcc-highdod/4223788#:~:text=2,our%20defense%20and%20government%20customers)). All prompts, content, and responses stay within the Microsoft 365 cloud boundary and **are not used to train the underlying models** ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=Important)). Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and Copilot only accesses data the user has permission to view (honoring SharePoint/Teams permissions) ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20Copilot%20only%20surfaces,shared%20channels%20in%20Microsoft%20Teams)).

- **Collaboration & In-Line Editing**: Copilot integrates directly into Office 365 apps to provide **real-time co-editing assistance**. For example, in Word or Teams, a user can draft a document or message while Copilot suggests edits, generates text, or summarizes content on the fly. Multiple team members can collaborate on a document with Copilot’s input appearing as suggestions or generated sections, similar to a Google Docs experience. This is designed to **improve team productivity and collaboration**, with Copilot able to facilitate communication and project management in a shared environment ([Azure OpenAI Service is FedRAMP High and Copilot for Microsoft 365 GCC High and DOD GA update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/publicsectorblog/azure-openai-service-is-fedramp-high-and-copilot-for-microsoft-365-gcc-high-and-/4222955#:~:text=Enhanced%20Decision%20Making%2C%20where%20Copilot,agencies%20make%20more%20informed%20decisions)). (For instance, Copilot can summarize a Teams discussion or update an action item in a shared plan.)

- **Data Integration & Research Capabilities**: Microsoft 365 Copilot can pull information from across the user’s **internal data in Microsoft Graph** – emails, SharePoint documents, calendar entries, meeting transcripts, chats, and more – to ground its responses ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20Copilot%20provides%20value,accurate%2C%20relevant%2C%20and%20contextual%20responses)). This enables deep research on internal, FedRAMP-compliant datasets (e.g. it can find relevant data from an agency’s SharePoint or OneDrive). Copilot also supports **third-party and public data via plugins**. For example, with the Bing Search plugin enabled, it can safely retrieve relevant info from the web; it parses the user’s query, performs a Bing web search, and then incorporates the results into its answer ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=,Copilot%20and%20Microsoft%20365%20Copilot)). Microsoft is extending Copilot with connectors to services like Jira, ServiceNow, and others (through the Microsoft 365 plugin ecosystem), which would allow querying private third-party sources in-line. All web and third-party queries are done in a compliant manner (the Copilot service itself opts out of using these queries or any customer data to train the foundation AI model ([Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy#:~:text=Important))).

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Beyond research and writing assistance, Microsoft 365 Copilot can perform **automated actions and workflows** in context. In Outlook, it can draft emails or even send them on command; in Teams, it can schedule meetings or assign tasks via Microsoft Planner. Copilot is being positioned to help with **decision support and task automation** – for example, analyzing a large dataset in Excel and producing a summary, or generating a first draft of a report and then emailing it to stakeholders ([Azure OpenAI Service is FedRAMP High and Copilot for Microsoft 365 GCC High and DOD GA update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/publicsectorblog/azure-openai-service-is-fedramp-high-and-copilot-for-microsoft-365-gcc-high-and-/4222955#:~:text=Enhanced%20Decision%20Making%2C%20where%20Copilot,agencies%20make%20more%20informed%20decisions)). Future versions (especially in the government cloud) are expected to include **intelligent task management** where Copilot automates routine tasks to streamline operations ([Azure OpenAI Service is FedRAMP High and Copilot for Microsoft 365 GCC High and DOD GA update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/publicsectorblog/azure-openai-service-is-fedramp-high-and-copilot-for-microsoft-365-gcc-high-and-/4222955#:~:text=Enhanced%20Decision%20Making%2C%20where%20Copilot,agencies%20make%20more%20informed%20decisions)). All these actions happen with user oversight (the user reviews email drafts, confirms scheduling, etc.), but they demonstrate agentic assistance. Microsoft’s documentation notes that Copilot will deliver AI tools for **decision-making, automation, and enhanced collaboration** while meeting strict compliance needs in government settings ([Azure OpenAI FedRAMP High + Microsoft 365 Copilot Targeting GA for GCC High and DOD by September 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft365copilot/azure-openai-fedramp-high--m365-copilot-targeting-sept-2025-for-gcc-highdod/4223788#:~:text=September%202025%20for%20Microsoft%20365,of%20our%20defense%20and%20government)) ([Azure OpenAI FedRAMP High + Microsoft 365 Copilot Targeting GA for GCC High and DOD by September 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft365copilot/azure-openai-fedramp-high--m365-copilot-targeting-sept-2025-for-gcc-highdod/4223788#:~:text=2,our%20defense%20and%20government%20customers)).

## Google Workspace “Duet AI” (Google)

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: Google Workspace (the suite including Docs, Sheets, Gmail, etc.) achieved **FedRAMP High authorization** in 2021, meaning it can handle federal data up to High impact level ([Government Program Solutions for Collaboration - Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/industries/government/#:~:text=Workspace%20workspace,help%20you%20transition%20to)). Google’s generative AI for Workspace, known as **Duet AI** (powered by models including Google’s Gemini), is in the process of FedRAMP approval. In late 2024 Google submitted Gemini for FedRAMP High authorization to extend these AI features to federal customers ([
  Google Workspace Updates: FedRAMP High authorization for Gemini for Workspace
  ](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-for-workspace-fedramp-high-authorization.html#:~:text=As%20recently%20announced%2C%20we%20submitted,cloud%20technologies%20for%20critical%20operations)). Until authorization is obtained, Duet AI features would only be available in restricted previews for government. From a data security perspective, Google emphasizes that **Workspace customer data is not used to train** the AI models ([Data privacy protections with Duet AI in Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/protecting-your-data-era-generative-ai#:~:text=Data%20privacy%20protections%20with%20Duet,and%20large%20language%20models)). All prompts and outputs stay within the organization’s Google Cloud boundary. Google also offers data location controls and has received IL4 (DoD Impact Level 4) provisional authorization, indicating strong security practices ([
  Google Workspace Updates: FedRAMP High authorization for Gemini for Workspace
  ](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-for-workspace-fedramp-high-authorization.html#:~:text=As%20recently%20announced%2C%20we%20submitted,cloud%20technologies%20for%20critical%20operations)).

- **Collaboration & In-Line Editing**: Duet AI is deeply embedded in Google’s real-time collaboration environment. In Google Docs, for instance, multiple users can co-edit a document while **Duet acts as an intelligent writing assistant**. A user can ask Duet to “help me write” on a topic, and it will generate content inline, which the team can then refine together. It can also **suggest edits and style improvements** as you type. This mirrors the familiar Google Docs experience (multiple cursors, suggestions) but augmented with AI. In Gmail, Duet can draft emails from brief instructions, and in Google Meet it can even take notes or **summarize meetings in real-time** for participants. The key is that the AI works in real time in the same collaborative space as the users – offering **autocomplete suggestions, summaries, and answers** in chat (Google Chat) or documents, without breaking the flow of teamwork.

- **Data Integration & Research Capabilities**: Out-of-the-box, Duet AI primarily leverages data within the Google Workspace domain for each user. This means it can pull in information from your emails, your Google Drive documents, your calendars, etc., to provide context-aware assistance. For example, in Gmail it can contextually summarize a long email thread or in Docs it might draw on a relevant file from Drive when asked a question. Google also provides an enterprise search feature (Cloud Search) that can index internal data and third-party sources; Duet AI can be expected to interface with such indexes to answer user queries with enterprise data. For instance, an agency could index its internal knowledge base (and even subscription data like Gartner reports if ingested into a Google Drive or Cloud Search), and Duet could retrieve from that. **Public web data** is not directly integrated into Google Workspace’s Duet by default (unlike Bing in Microsoft’s case). However, users can of course use Google’s core Search separately. Google has been careful with direct web integration in Workspace due to data governance, but it’s evolving. (Notably, Google’s Vertex AI Search, a separate product, can do retrieval-augmented QA from selected web sources, which could be a route to bring web data into Workspace in the future). In summary, Duet currently excels at helping draft and analyze content you provide, rather than acting as an open-web research agent – though it can certainly help summarize public info a user pastes in. Google’s focus is ensuring any integration with external data is done via approved connectors or APIs in a secure manner.

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Duet AI’s primary role is assistive (drafting, summarizing, answering), and it generally stops short of taking autonomous actions without user direction. It can generate emails or document content, but the user sends the email or finalizes the doc. That said, Duet is adding productivity features that blur the line into automation. For example, in Google Calendar, Duet can **schedule meetings for you** (if you prompt it with something like “find a meeting time with Alice next week”), effectively acting on your behalf within that app. In Google Meet, a feature called “Attend for me” allows Duet to join a meeting, deliver a brief message, and take notes – essentially automating an attendance task. These are early forms of agentic behavior under user control. Duet AI can also interface with Google AppSheet (a no-code tool) to create simple workflows or apps from natural language, demonstrating basic **workflow automation**. It does not yet have a multi-step autonomous agent that can, say, browse the web and perform multi-faceted tasks on its own (and any such capabilities would be gated by admin controls and compliance). The value-added actions Duet provides today are within Google’s own services (drafting replies, organizing content, summarizing and transcribing, etc.). As Google’s Gemini AI matures, we expect more agentic functions, but always with a human in the loop and aligned to compliance (e.g., an admin can disable any feature not permitted, and all actions are audit-logged).

## Primer Delta and Command (Primer AI)

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: **Primer** offers an AI platform tailored for intelligence analysis and deep research, used in defense and government. Primer’s platform (often referred to as _Primer Delta_, with _Primer Command_ for real-time OSINT) is on a path to high security accreditation. Through a partnership with Palantir, **Primer Delta is being delivered in a FedRAMP authorized IL5 environment** ([Primer announces FedRAMP security - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/news/primer-ai-announces-fedramp-security/#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO%2C%20CA%2C%20September%2011%2C,agencies%20through%20Palantir%E2%80%99s%20FedStart%20offering)). In 2023, Primer announced that its platform will carry a FedRAMP designation and DoD Impact Level 5 authorization via Palantir’s FedStart program ([Primer announces FedRAMP security - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/news/primer-ai-announces-fedramp-security/#:~:text=SAN%20FRANCISCO%2C%20CA%2C%20September%2011%2C,agencies%20through%20Palantir%E2%80%99s%20FedStart%20offering)). (Palantir FedStart allows third-party products like Primer to run in Palantir’s already accredited cloud framework). Additionally, Primer has an Authority to Operate on JWICS (the high-security intelligence network) and meets IL5 requirements in that deployment ([Primer Delta - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-delta/#:~:text=%2A%20)) – underscoring its focus on strict government compliance. All data processed by Primer’s tools stays within the secure government cloud or on-premise environment of the client. Primer’s models and algorithms can even be deployed in classified environments, and they use a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Verification (RAG-V)** approach to minimize errors and hallucinations. Notably, Primer claims its validation tech catches over **99% of errors before they reach users**, ensuring outputs are **traceable to verified sources** ([Primer Delta - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-delta/#:~:text=%2A%20)). This is a critical security feature: analysts can trust but verify every AI-generated statement by checking its sources, which is essential for high-stakes government use.

- **Collaboration & Co-Editing**: Primer’s solutions are designed for **analysts and researchers to collaborate with AI** in producing intelligence reports and analyses. While Primer isn’t a word processor like Google Docs, it provides a workbench where users ask questions and get draft narratives that they can refine. Primer Delta’s interface allows an analyst to search and explore data, then **quickly compile findings into a report** ([Primer Delta - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-delta/#:~:text=Enable)). The AI can generate drafted sections of text (with citations) that the user can edit or approve. Multiple analysts can use Primer in parallel on their own investigations, and then share the AI-generated insights or reports through the platform. Primer supports exporting fully sourced reports which can be reviewed by a team. In essence, **the collaboration happens in how AI accelerates the research legwork**, allowing human analysts to focus on interpreting and editing the results. Team collaboration is further supported by the ability to distribute intelligence products: Primer makes it easy to share the AI’s output up the chain of command or with other departments ([Home - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/#:~:text=generate%20reports%20on%20rapidly%20evolving,at%20times%20of%20critical%20need)). For instance, one analyst could use Primer to generate a brief and another analyst or editor could simultaneously fact-check it (since sources are attached) and polish the language. This is more of a sequential collaboration than live co-editing of the exact same text, but it significantly speeds up multi-person workflows that produce analytic written products.

- **Data Integration & Deep Research**: The core strength of Primer’s platform is **aggregating and searching vast amounts of data** (both structured and unstructured) and returning synthesized insights. Primer Delta is essentially a semantic search and analysis engine that plugs into **your enterprise or agency data**. It can index millions of documents across various repositories – internal document databases, SharePoint, email archives, intelligence reports, etc. – and let users query in natural language. The AI will **scan “millions of documents” and deliver precise answers** to the query ([Primer Delta - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-delta/#:~:text=Search)), complete with references. This covers internal datasets (including classified data, when deployed in classified networks). Primer also integrates **external data sources**: for example, Primer Command (a complementary product) ingests roughly 5 million posts per day from social media, news, and blogs to monitor real-time events ([Command - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-command/#:~:text=Seize%20every%20advantage%20and%20empower,social%20media%20and%20news%20landscapes)) ([Command - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/primer-command/#:~:text=Image)). Government users can include open-source intelligence (OSINT) feeds – from live web data to subscription services like Janes, or industry research – into the platform. If an agency has licensed data (say from Gartner or Factiva), that can be ingested so that Primer will include those in its semantic search results. Additionally, via Palantir’s integration, Primer can access data that Palantir’s platform connects to (such as various databases and data lakes in government). In practice, an analyst can ask, “What do Gartner and Forrester say about Zero Trust security?” and if those reports are loaded internally, Primer will retrieve relevant sentences and provide a summary with citations. Or an intelligence officer could ask, “Summarize recent drone sightings in region X from our reports and news,” and Primer will pull from internal SIGACT reports as well as live news sources. **All results are source-attributed**, enabling deep trust in the research process. Primer’s approach of constant grounding in actual documents (rather than just model knowledge) is crucial for verifiable research in government use.

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Primer’s primary function is to **retrieve, analyze, and synthesize information**, rather than to perform operational tasks on behalf of users. It stops short of executing external actions like sending emails or triggering workflows (in contrast to some more workflow-oriented AI agents). However, within the analytic process, Primer does automate a lot of what would be manual labor. For example, it automatically generates digests of trends (saving analysts from reading thousands of documents), it can run ongoing monitoring (Primer Command can alert users to emerging narratives or changes in sentiment 24/7), and it helps compile reports quickly ([Home - PrimerAI](https://primer.ai/#:~:text=generate%20reports%20on%20rapidly%20evolving,at%20times%20of%20critical%20need)). These are **“value-added” automations in the research workflow** – essentially automating the data collection, reading, and initial writing steps that a human would do, thus acting as a force-multiplier for analysts. Primer’s platform can also integrate with other tools (via APIs or Palantir’s mechanisms) to insert its insights into dashboards or send alerts. For instance, if Primer identifies a critical piece of intelligence, it could be configured to flag a human or populate a field in another system. But importantly, any final actions (like disseminating a report or making a decision) are left to human users. Primer does plan to continually shorten the “time to insight,” so we may see more agentic features like recommending next steps or auto-updating certain knowledge bases. Given the sensitive contexts it’s used in, Primer keeps a human in the loop for decisions. In summary, Primer is an **analytic co-pilot**: it autonomously handles data crunching and initial synthesis, and while it might not autonomously send an email, it dramatically automates the groundwork for informed decisions and allows users to act faster on the information.

## Palantir AIP (Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform)

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: **Palantir AIP** is an AI platform built on Palantir’s existing government-grade infrastructure. Palantir’s cloud offerings (Foundry, Gotham, and the new AIP included) have achieved **FedRAMP High baseline authorization as of Dec 2024** ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)). This means AIP can be used for **“the most sensitive unclassified workloads”** in U.S. government ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20company%20said%20Tuesday%20the,and%20PFCS%20%E2%80%93%20Supporting%20Services)), and Palantir also holds DoD IL5/6 for higher classification levels ([Palantir Receives FedRAMP High Baseline Status for Cloud Services - ExecutiveBiz](https://executivebiz.com/2024/12/palantir-fedramp-high-baseline-authorization/#:~:text=The%20accreditation%20extends%20across%20Palantir%E2%80%99s,Gotham%2C%20FedStart%20and%20Mission%20Manager)). Security is a hallmark of Palantir – data is strictly partitioned, access controls are extremely granular, and all actions are logged. AIP inherits these controls: an agency can deploy AIP so that it runs on a private network (including on classified networks) with **full control over which data the AI can access and what it can do** ([Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/aip/#:~:text=Palantir%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Platform%20Run,private%20network%20with%20full%20control)) ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=can%20be%20provided%20with%20an,Lets%20dive%20into%20these)). Palantir emphasizes guardrails: AIP is configured with “**guard-railed access**” to data and tools ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=can%20be%20provided%20with%20an,Lets%20dive%20into%20these)). Each AI agent in AIP is isolated to only see the data it’s supposed to (“views of the connected ontology” per configuration) ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Agent%20Isolation%20and%20Independence)), preventing any accidental data leak across departments. Furthermore, Palantir has built-in mechanisms for human feedback and override. No output leaves the environment unless approved by the organization. In short, AIP is built to **government security specs from the ground up**, leveraging Palantir’s longstanding role in defense and intel (which includes prior ATOs and robust compliance practices).

- **Collaboration & Co-Editing**: Palantir AIP is less about co-writing documents and more about **embedding AI into collaborative data workflows**. In a Palantir environment, often many users (analysts, operators) collaborate on a common dataset or mission, sharing insights through the platform’s dashboards and objects. AIP introduces a conversational interface and AI-driven actions into this mix. For example, multiple analysts could be examining supply chain data in Palantir Foundry and use AIP’s chat interface to query the data in natural language. The **AI can draft an analysis or recommend decisions** which the team can then review within the platform. If the team is writing a report in Palantir (Palantir has modules for documentations or “notebooks”), AIP can help populate that report. Palantir demonstrated a “chat with your data” style collaboration: a user asks a question, the AI retrieves info and even produces a draft directive, and another user can tweak the parameters or ask a follow-up. **Human-AI teaming** is central: Palantir often refers to “keeping a human in the loop”. They even provide a **“cockpit” for human operators** to supervise and intervene when the AI is unsure ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=In%20some%20cases%2C%20a%20human,%E2%80%98unsure%E2%80%99%20and%20requires%20human%20inputs)). This means while one operator converses with the AI agent, another can monitor suggestions and approve or correct them – a novel collaborative workflow between humans and AI. In mission contexts (like military planning), multiple staff officers might collaboratively prompt AIP to explore scenarios, with the AI producing outputs that they jointly edit and turn into orders or reports. So, the collaboration isn’t a Google-Docs style text co-edit per se, but rather **collaboration on decision-making and data interpretation with AI as an active participant**. All users share a common view of what the AI is suggesting, and they can accept or modify those suggestions in real-time.

- **Data Integration & Research Capabilities**: Palantir’s forte is data integration, and AIP fully capitalizes on that. AIP can tap into the entire **Palantir “ontology”** – which is basically a unified layer representing all of an organization’s data (databases, documents, sensor feeds, transaction logs, you name it). This means the AI can **draw from internal systems (ERP, CRM, HR, custom databases)** and cross-correlate information. For example, AIP could answer a query like “How many open investigations involve Person X and what contracts are they tied to?” by pulling from case management systems and contract databases in one go. In Palantir’s own demo, AIP was tied into systems like SAP and Salesforce ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Data%20Landscape)) – showing that it can combine operational data (orders, customer info) with other context. It can also bring in **external data** if available in the environment: e.g., if connected to an open-source intelligence feed or a web API, AIP can incorporate that. Many Palantir deployments ingest third-party data such as commercial satellite imagery, financial market data, or research reports, so AIP would make that queryable in natural language as well. Moreover, AIP allows semantic search similar to others: you can ask in plain English and get **“fluent and grounded” answers** (likely with sources, as Palantir has been working on explainable AI ([How Palantir AIP Improves LLM Explainability](https://blog.palantir.com/thinking-outside-the-black-box-24d0c87ec8a5#:~:text=How%20Palantir%20AIP%20Improves%20LLM,AI%20systems%20within%20Palantir%20AIP))). Because Palantir now has FedRAMP High, even data from law enforcement or health records (Privacy Act, HIPAA data) could theoretically be integrated safely for AI analysis, with all compliance controls in place. In summary, AIP’s AI does “deep research” across any data you give Palantir – internal, proprietary third-party, or curated open data – and it does so with the context of Palantir’s strong data lineage (so you can always trace where info came from). This makes it extremely powerful for government users who often need to correlate across silos.

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Palantir AIP is explicitly designed to **turn conversations into actions**. Unlike a read-only chatbot, it can carry out operations in connected systems with the proper permissions. Palantir introduced the concept of **“Actions”** in AIP: these are custom-defined operations the AI can execute, such as updating a database record, calling an external API, or even running a piece of code ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Our%20agents%20need%20to%20be,execution%20using%20Function%20on%20Objects)). For example, if an analyst says, “Approve all low-risk cases and notify the applicants,” AIP (if configured to do so) could execute an action that marks those cases as approved in the system and sends template emails – all autonomously or with one-click confirmation. In one scenario Palantir described, an AI agent can autonomously handle a customer service request: classify the request, look up order details in SAP, run a machine learning model to get an estimated delivery date, then draft an email response to the customer and even execute an order update if needed ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=,response%20based%20on%20the%20suggested)) ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Our%20agents%20need%20to%20be,execution%20using%20Function%20on%20Objects)). All of that is done by chaining various Actions that AIP is allowed to use. **External interactions** are possible too: AIP could call an external web service or trigger a workflow in another application as an action ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Our%20agents%20need%20to%20be,execution%20using%20Function%20on%20Objects)). Essentially, Palantir AIP enables an **autonomous agent** within the bounds you set – it can be as agentic as you trust it to be. Many government uses will keep a human decision-maker in the loop (for example, AIP may prepare a set of actions but wait for a human to approve execution). But the platform supports full automation if policies permit. This includes things like: automatically reallocating resources when an AI detects a logistic issue, or flagging inconsistencies and correcting data entries across systems. Because Palantir integrates with operational systems (and not just knowledge stores), **the AI can have real-world impact** (e.g., adjusting a satellite’s tasking schedule or re-routing a supply convoy in software). Robust safeguards (like requiring human sign-off or providing explanations for each action) are part of the design to maintain control. In summary, Palantir AIP goes beyond information synthesis: it’s an “autonomous operations” co-pilot. It primarily retrieves and summarizes data to inform decisions, but it _also_ can carry out those decisions or other tedious tasks, effectively functioning as a junior analyst or assistant that not only writes recommendations but can implement them under supervision ([Palantir's Customer Service Engine, Part 2 | Palantir Blog](https://blog.palantir.com/turning-conversation-into-action-c6bc4ed8c8be#:~:text=Our%20agents%20need%20to%20be,execution%20using%20Function%20on%20Objects)).

## Moveworks AI Platform

- **FedRAMP Status & Security**: **Moveworks** provides an AI assistant platform, historically focused on enterprise IT and HR support, now extending to government use. As of early 2025, Moveworks has achieved **FedRAMP Ready** status for its dedicated GovCloud environment ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20why%20we%20take%20immense,FedRAMP%20process%20and%20its%20requirements)). This indicates a 3PAO (third-party assessor) has vetted their readiness for FedRAMP, and Moveworks is actively pursuing full authorization. In fact, Moveworks is targeting a **FedRAMP Moderate authorization** for its platform in AWS GovCloud ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Key%20aspects%2C%20such%20as%20heightened,data%20protection%20and%20security%20compliance)), which would allow use with sensitive but unclassified data across federal agencies. (FedRAMP Moderate covers a wide range of government data; High might be pursued later if needed for things like law enforcement data.) Moveworks GovCloud is hosted in a U.S. Gov AWS region (us-gov-east-1) in a **segregated environment to ensure data isolation** ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Working%20with%20Moveworks%20GovCloud)). Government customer data is kept separate from commercial data, and all the security controls (encryption, auditing, access control) are in place to meet FedRAMP requirements. Moveworks also emphasizes “top-tier security” including SSO, encryption, and compliance alignment by design ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=1.%20Top,commitment%20to%20security%20and%20privacy)). Like others, Moveworks does not use customer-specific data to train its base AI models; each customer’s data is only used to serve that customer (this is essential for privacy given it often ingests internal knowledge base content). Achieving FedRAMP Ready and moving to authorized status shows Moveworks’ commitment to meeting government cloud security standards.

- **Collaboration & In-Line Experience**: Moveworks offers an AI **digital assistant** that typically lives in chat interfaces like **Microsoft Teams or Slack** for real-time interaction ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=5,including%20Microsoft%20Teams%20or%20Slack)). While this is a different modality than document co-editing, it still enables a form of in-line collaboration: users can ask the Moveworks bot questions or even have it draft messages/documents, right within the conversation. For example, an employee could be in a Teams channel and query the Moveworks AI for information (“What’s the procedure for onboarding a contractor?”) and the AI will instantly provide an answer or even a snippet of a document. That answer can be edited by the user or shared with colleagues. Multiple users can be in the same channel and see the AI’s response, effectively **collaborating with the AI as a team**. Moveworks also introduced features like “Brief Me” (an AI summarizer) which can summarize lengthy content for a user in a chat, and “QuickGPT” for ad-hoc queries ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=,Quick%20GPT%20New)). In terms of co-editing text, a user could ask Moveworks to draft a piece of text (say a reply to an IT ticket or an email to a customer), and then refine it themselves – similar to how one would use an AI writing assistant. The key collaborative aspect is that Moveworks brings AI help into the _same tools where people are already collaborating_. In an organization, instead of going to a separate app to chat with AI, you add the Moveworks bot to your project channel or open it in your chat sidebar, and then **both you and your colleagues can leverage it in context**. This makes the AI a participant in the conversation, which is a powerful paradigm for collaboration (for instance, the AI can dynamically fetch data or answers while humans focus on strategy). While Moveworks may not offer a multi-user document editor, it enables real-time co-creation of knowledge in chat, which many find just as valuable during day-to-day work.

- **Data Integration & Research**: Moveworks connects to a **wide array of enterprise data sources** to answer questions and fulfill requests. It has an extensive **plugin and integration library** ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=helping%20enable%20a%20quick%20return,on%20your%20investment)) – out-of-the-box connectors for platforms like ServiceNow (ITSM data), Salesforce, Workday (HR data), Confluence or SharePoint (knowledge bases), etc. For an agency, Moveworks could index internal policy documents, FAQs, wikis, as well as connect to systems (e.g., an asset management database or a case tracking system). It uses semantic NLP search to retrieve relevant information from these sources when a user asks a question. For third-party private data, if an agency has licensed content (like Gartner research), an administrator could load those documents into a knowledge base that Moveworks indexes, and the AI would then be able to answer queries based on that content. Similarly, Moveworks can tap into public web data **if explicitly integrated** – for example, if connected to a company’s public website or a curated internet knowledge source. By default, it focuses on the organization’s internal data (to avoid any compliance issues with pulling arbitrary web content), but it’s capable of calling external APIs. In fact, Moveworks’ plugin architecture could allow an integration with a web search API or a specific external database if a use-case demanded it. The platform also supports multi-turn conversations, meaning if the initial answer isn’t sufficient, the user can ask follow-ups and Moveworks will use context to refine its retrieval. In summary, Moveworks acts as a unified **semantic search and action engine** across all enterprise knowledge sources – from the employee handbook to the latest vendor records – presenting the result conversationally. It **understands natural language queries** and returns answers or performs lookups across these connected systems to save the user from manually searching each database ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=2,of%20government%20or%20enterprise%20data)) ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=5,including%20Microsoft%20Teams%20or%20Slack)).

- **Agentic Capabilities**: Moveworks is built not just to fetch information, but also to **take actions to resolve user requests automatically**. This is one of its standout features, especially in IT support scenarios. For instance, if a user says “I can’t access VPN,” Moveworks can proactively create a help desk ticket in ServiceNow, or even attempt to auto-resolve the issue by triggering a workflow (like resetting the VPN account). The platform comes with many **pre-trained “skills” or agents** for common tasks – resetting passwords, provisioning software, answering HR questions, etc. – and can integrate with enterprise workflows to execute those tasks. Moveworks describes this as enabling organizations to **“use and build AI agents”** that handle end-to-end processes ([Moveworks is now a FedRAMP (®) Ready agentic AI platform dedicated to the public sector | Moveworks](https://www.moveworks.com/us/en/resources/blog/moveworks-achieves-fedramp-ready-designation#:~:text=Microsoft%20Teams%20or%20Slack)). Through its **Creator Studio**, developers at an agency can define custom workflows that Moveworks will carry out. For example, an HR team could create an agent that, when asked “Enroll me in the 401k plan,” will navigate the internal HR system and initiate that enrollment. These actions are performed autonomously by the AI agent (after appropriate authentication), not just suggested. Moveworks’ **agentic AI** extends to sending communications: it can dispatch emails or Teams messages for notifications (“Your VPN access has been restored” to the user, for example). It basically serves as a 24/7 virtual assistant that can transact on behalf of users for routine needs. Importantly, guardrails are in place – it only performs actions it’s been explicitly configured and permitted to do, and sensitive operations can require confirmation. In a federal context, this could translate to automating workflows like onboarding a user to a system (with proper approvals), or gathering data from multiple systems into a report. While Moveworks is mostly oriented toward IT/service desk use cases, those agentic capabilities can be applied more broadly (any repetitive multi-step process could potentially be handled by a Moveworks bot). As Moveworks evolves in the government space, we might see domain-specific agents (for finance, procurement, etc.). But even out-of-the-box, it brings a strong toolkit of **autonomous workflow fulfillment** that goes beyond Q&A. This can significantly reduce the manual workload on staff by handling the “last mile” of a query – not just giving an answer, but completing the task.

## Additional Noteworthy Solutions and Considerations

In addition to the above specific products, it’s worth mentioning the broader ecosystem and emerging solutions:

- **AWS Generative AI Stack (Amazon Bedrock & Kendra)**: Amazon Web Services provides building blocks rather than a single end-user co-pilot, but these are important COTS components agencies can leverage. **Amazon Kendra**, an intelligent semantic search service, is FedRAMP Moderate and even **FedRAMP High authorized** in certain regions ([Amazon Kendra is now FedRAMP High Compliant - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-kendra-fedramp-high-compliant/#:~:text=Amazon%20Kendra%20is%20now%20authorized,search%20service%20powered%20by)). It allows organizations to index internal documents and websites and ask natural language questions, much like an AI research assistant. Kendra can be paired with AWS’s new **Amazon Bedrock** service, which provides access to foundation models (like Amazon’s Titan, Anthropic’s Claude, etc.) in a fully managed, secure way. Notably, Amazon Bedrock itself achieved **FedRAMP High authorization in GovCloud** in 2024 ([Amazon Bedrock achieves FedRAMP High authorization - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-bedrock-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization#:~:text=Posted%20on%3A%20Aug%201%2C%202024)). Using these, a government agency could construct its own in-line editing co-pilot – for example, integrating a Q&A chatbot into a custom knowledge portal or even into Microsoft Word via an add-in. AWS has published guides on building a FedRAMP-compliant generative chatbot using Bedrock ([Build a FedRAMP compliant generative AI-powered chatbot using ...](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/build-a-fedramp-compliant-generative-ai-powered-chatbot-using-amazon-aurora-machine-learning-and-amazon-bedrock/#:~:text=Build%20a%20FedRAMP%20compliant%20generative,of%20which%20are%20FedRAMP%20compliant)). The difference is that AWS’s solution here is not out-of-the-box UI; it requires development effort to integrate. But it offers maximum flexibility: one could connect to internal data, private data (via Kendra connectors), and do live web queries (via APIs) while staying within a FedRAMP High environment. And with Bedrock’s support for creating “agents” that can execute AWS Lambda functions, there is potential for agentic behavior (like updating a database when prompted) ([Amazon Bedrock achieves FedRAMP High authorization - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-bedrock-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization#:~:text=performing%20foundation%20models%20,your%20applications%20using%20other%20AWS)) ([Amazon Bedrock achieves FedRAMP High authorization - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-bedrock-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization#:~:text=customize%20them%20with%20your%20data,you%20can%20securely%20integrate%20and)). In short, AWS’s COTS services enable a **DIY co-pilot** that can meet strict compliance – indeed some vendors like Moveworks build on AWS – though agencies must assemble the pieces to create a seamless user experience.

- **OpenAI and Others**: OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise, while very popular in commercial settings, does not yet have FedRAMP authorization in a government cloud. However, OpenAI’s models are accessible in the Azure Government (via Azure OpenAI) and AWS GovCloud (via Bedrock) as noted. There are also specialized startups focusing on secure, domain-specific co-pilots – for example, **Primer (covered above)** is one, and others include **HyperScience** (document-processing AI that got FedRAMP High via Palantir FedStart ([Hyperscience Achieves FedRamp High Accreditation with Palantir](https://www.hyperscience.com/newsroom/hyperscience-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization-through-strategic-partnership-with-palantir/#:~:text=Hyperscience%20Achieves%20FedRamp%20High%20Accreditation,performance%2C%20security%2C%20and%20compliance%20standards))), and **Manifest** (SBOM analysis AI, also piggybacking on Palantir’s High authorization) – these indicate a trend: new AI services leveraging existing FedRAMP-authorized platforms to accelerate compliance ([Manifest Achieves FedRAMP® High Authorization Through Palantir ...](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/manifest-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization-through-palantir-technologies-302343468.html#:~:text=Manifest%20Achieves%20FedRAMP%C2%AE%20High%20Authorization,authorized%20environment)) ([Hyperscience Achieves FedRamp High Accreditation with Palantir](https://www.hyperscience.com/newsroom/hyperscience-achieves-fedramp-high-authorization-through-strategic-partnership-with-palantir/#:~:text=Hyperscience%20Achieves%20FedRamp%20High%20Accreditation,performance%2C%20security%2C%20and%20compliance%20standards)). Another example is **IBM’s watsonx** suite; IBM has long provided AI tools to government (with on-prem deployments for compliance) and is likely moving toward FedRAMP for its cloud offerings. _IBM Watson Orchestrate_ (an AI “digital worker” that can do tasks like scheduling and emailing) is an analog to some agentic co-pilots, and while not FedRAMPed as a SaaS yet, IBM’s cloud for government is FedRAMP Moderate and could host such a service. **Atlassian** is bringing AI (via Atlassian Intelligence) into Confluence and Jira for smarter collaboration; Atlassian’s government cloud is in process for FedRAMP Moderate ([We've achieved “In Process” status on the FedRAMP Marketplace!](https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Trust-Security-articles/We-ve-achieved-In-Process-status-on-the-FedRAMP-Marketplace/ba-p/2756436#:~:text=We%27ve%20achieved%20%E2%80%9CIn%20Process%E2%80%9D%20status,Cloud%20while%20safeguarding%20your)), so its AI features would follow accordingly. These examples show a landscape of emerging co-pilot solutions focusing on specific niches (DevOps, documentation, process automation) that are on the horizon for government use as they achieve the necessary compliance.

Essentially acts as an autonomous helpdesk agent for routine tasks. |

Each of these solutions provides a **blend of AI-driven research and productivity** while maintaining strong security postures required for government use. Microsoft and Google are bringing familiar productivity suites into the AI era with upcoming FedRAMP-authorized co-pilots, focusing on content creation and teamwork. Primer and Palantir offer mission-focused analytic platforms where the AI digs through data and supports high-stakes decisions with full traceability and compliance. Moveworks (and similar enterprise assistant platforms) show how AI can be a practical teammate in everyday workflows, automating drudgery securely within an organization’s IT stack.

When evaluating these solutions, agencies should consider trade-offs like **maturity vs. customization**. Microsoft and Google’s offerings will seamlessly enhance existing office workflows but are on the cusp of FedRAMP availability (timelines mid-2025) and may have constraints on connecting outside their ecosystems. Primer and Palantir are powerful for deep analysis, already proven in defense environments, but they are specialized (best for intelligence, operations, or data-rich scenarios). Moveworks demonstrates quick wins in employee-facing automation and knowledge delivery, though it might need expansion for broader research use cases.

All solutions prioritize **data security and isolation**, ensuring no AI model is trained on agency data and that sensitive information doesn’t leak. FedRAMP (and related DoD SRG) compliance status is a key differentiator – it signals which solutions can be adopted now versus which are promising but pending approval. The good news is the landscape is rapidly evolving, with a clear trend: **AI co-pilots are coming to the government in a compliant way**, bringing generative AI’s power to help research, write, decide, and act – all within the guardrails required for public sector trust.
