# Initial Response
Now Assist for Test Creation is a generative-AI capability in the ServiceNow Yokohama release that converts plain-language instructions into fully built Automated Test Framework (ATF) test cases, eliminating the drudgery of manual step recording.

# Now Assist for Test Creation

**Overview:** Introduced in the **Yokohama release** (ServiceNow 2025), *Now Assist for Test Creation* is a new AI-powered skill (part of Now Assist for Creator v27.1) that automates the generation of ServiceNow ATF (Automated Test Framework) test cases.  ServiceNow added **“Test generation”** as one of five new generative AI skills in Yokohama ([

Now Assist for Test Creation leverages natural-language processing: a user types a prompt describing a scenario (for example, *“Create a new user named Bill McDermott, assign the itil role, and open an incident with description ‘My New Test Record’”*), and the tool automatically builds a full ATF test script covering all the form entries, role assignments, and validations ([

## Key Features

- **Natural-language test generation:** Using AI/NLP, Now Assist converts descriptive prompts into structured ATF tests.  Developers simply describe actions (e.g. “create a new record in table X and verify field Y”) and the system outputs a complete test script with the appropriate steps and data ([

- **Time and accuracy gains:** Automated generation eliminates many manual clicks and scripting steps.  In practice, users report roughly *80% faster* test creation than manual methods ([
	AI-Powered ATF Testing: How Now Assist for Test Cr... - ServiceNow Community
](https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-advocate-blog/ai-powered-atf-testing-how-now-assist-for-test-creation-saves/ba-p/3177051#:~:text=%E2%9C%85%20Save%20time%20%E2%80%93%20Reduce,tests%20for%20various%20ServiceNow%20components)), with consistent formatting and fewer typos or omissions.  
- **Improved test coverage:** Because it handles each form interaction systematically, Now Assist helps cover more fields and flows than a user might manually.  It can generate tests across different modules (e.g. user provisioning, incident logging, service catalog items, etc.) in one workflow, reducing human error and ensuring broader QA coverage ([

- **Preview of test steps:** After generating the test, Now Assist provides a **step-by-step preview** showing the execution order and details of each step before saving ([
	What's new in Now Assist for Creator? Yokohama sto... - ServiceNow Community
](https://www.servicenow.com/community/now-assist-for-creator-articles/what-s-new-in-now-assist-for-creator-yokohama-store-release/ta-p/3162010#:~:text=Image%3A%20Test%20step%20preview%20is,the%20contents%20of%20each%20step)).  This lets users quickly verify or tweak the generated test actions (for instance, checking that the right fields and values are used).  
- **Cross-component scenarios:** The tool can chain multiple actions in one prompt. For example, a single prompt that mentions creating a user and opening an incident yields a test with both steps handled in sequence ([
	AI-Powered ATF Testing: How Now Assist for Test Cr... - ServiceNow Community
](https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-advocate-blog/ai-powered-atf-testing-how-now-assist-for-test-creation-saves/ba-p/3177051#:~:text=,description%20%27My%20New%20Test%20Record%E2%80%99)).  This means you can generate multi-module tests (users, incidents, approvals, etc.) from one description.

## Use Cases

- **Accelerating regression testing:**  Organizations can use Now Assist to quickly regenerate or expand ATF test suites whenever they upgrade ServiceNow or update apps. For example, after an upgrade, a team might prompt Now Assist to validate all core ITSM workflows (incidents, changes, service requests) by describing each workflow in plain language. This automates creation of smoke and regression tests that would otherwise be manually scripted.  
- **Testing new applications/workflows:**  When building a custom app or workflow, developers can describe key scenarios and get initial test cases instantly. For instance, describing a new form’s fields and expected outcomes yields a starter ATF test for that form.  This helps validate new functionality early and ensures coverage of business logic without writing each step by hand.  
- **Empowering non-developers:**  Now Assist lowers the barrier for QA analysts or business owners to contribute to testing. A tester can type a business-oriented prompt (no coding needed) and receive a working test script.  This is useful when subject-matter experts want to encode acceptance criteria as tests but don’t know ATF scripting.  
- **Example scenario (ATF demo):**  In a demo or training setting, an instructor might show how Now Assist converts a user story into a test. For example: “‘Assign a user as CISO and then verify they can access the security dashboard.’”  Now Assist would generate an ATF test with steps like creating a user, assigning the CISO role, and checking the dashboard. This showcases multi-step workflow testing.  
- **Increasing QA coverage:**  Test teams can prompt the AI to generate variations of a scenario (e.g. different input values or edge cases) and rapidly create many similar tests, improving overall coverage of potential workflows.  

## Best Practices

- **Be specific and precise:**  The output quality depends on the prompt detail. Specify exact names, values, and actions. For example, say “Set price to $800” instead of just “800,” and clearly indicate the action (create, update, or validate) ([
	AI-Powered ATF Testing: How Now Assist for Test Cr... - ServiceNow Community
](https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-advocate-blog/ai-powered-atf-testing-how-now-assist-for-test-creation-saves/ba-p/3177051#:~:text=%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%20Be%20Specific%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Instead%20of,create%2C%20update%2C%20or%20validate%20fields)). Including full context (table/form names, user roles, etc.) helps Now Assist generate correct steps.  
- **Use clear actions:**  Verbose prompts work best when each step is unambiguous. If you want to update a field, say “update field X to value Y”; if you want to check a result, say “verify that field Z equals Y” ([
	AI-Powered ATF Testing: How Now Assist for Test Cr... - ServiceNow Community
](https://www.servicenow.com/community/developer-advocate-blog/ai-powered-atf-testing-how-now-assist-for-test-creation-saves/ba-p/3177051#:~:text=%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%20Be%20Specific%C2%A0%E2%80%93%20Instead%20of,create%2C%20update%2C%20or%20validate%20fields)). This clarity helps the AI choose the right ATF step types.  
- **Review and refine:**  Always examine the generated test preview before running it. Now Assist shows each step in order (with descriptions) ([
	What's new in Now Assist for Creator? Yokohama sto... - ServiceNow Community
](https://www.servicenow.com/community/now-assist-for-creator-articles/what-s-new-in-now-assist-for-creator-yokohama-store-release/ta-p/3162010#:~:text=Image%3A%20Test%20step%20preview%20is,the%20contents%20of%20each%20step)), so use that to confirm accuracy. If something is missing or incorrect, adjust your prompt or split it into smaller parts and try again. Iteratively refining the prompt (or editing the draft steps) ensures the final test matches requirements.  
- **Iterate prompts for complex tasks:**  For very complex workflows, it can help to break the prompt into a series of smaller prompts, generating sub-tests that you then combine.  Use Now Assist’s preview to guide each iteration.  
- **Leverage as a starting point:**  Treat the generated test as a draft. You should still verify logic (for example, check data validation rules or business-specific conditions that the AI might not infer). Manually fine-tuning the AI’s output ensures the final test is robust.  

**Sources:** Now Assist for Test Creation is a Yokohama release feature that “generates test cases automatically” from text prompts ([
