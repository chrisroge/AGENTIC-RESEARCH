Research and understanding availability of "deep research" agentic platforms or tools which can semantically search internal Fed-ramp data as well as public/private API accessible or browser accessible data to form a comprehensive understanding and solve business problems. 

Requirements:
1. Deep research spanning internal and external data
2. Cab be hosted in a private cloud (Fed-ramp) environment 
3. No data is retained or utilized for future model training

The platform or tool performing deep research must be hosted in or run within a private cloud, such as a Fed-ramp AWS VPC, and can search/crawl internal an external data. 

The platform or tool should be able to interact with command line, bash prompt, browser, operating system.  We are looking for a fully agentic approach to deep research. 

We must avoid any models which can share or train on our data. 

All security considerations should be well understood, we are not at this time evaluating specific security standards. 

Our preference is commercial off the shelf but we will consider open source solutions 

Could you clarify a few points to refine the research:

- **Internal Data Sources**: Are there specific internal data sources or databases (e.g., proprietary datasets, document management systems) that the platform needs to integrate with?
- **APIs & Browsers**: Should the tool support only structured API calls, or should it also be capable of scraping web-based content?
- **Operating System Interaction**: Should the tool be able to execute OS-level commands (e.g., file system interactions, executing scripts)?
- **Preferred Commercial or Open Source Solutions**: While you prefer COTS solutions, would you be open to hybrid solutions (e.g., open-source with commercial support)?
- **Compliance Considerations**: While security standards are not the focus, should FedRAMP Moderate/High compliance be an implicit requirement?
- **Preferred AI Model Type**: Do you prefer symbolic AI, large language models (LLMs) with strict data isolation, or hybrid AI approaches?

Providing these details will help pinpoint the most suitable platforms.


Our preference is commercial off the shelf but we will consider open source solutions 

Internal Data sources can be any API accessible data sources, prioritize semantic search, assume we need some capability to generate embeddings for internal data

We should consider the need for agents to utilize tools in a human like fashion, such as interacting with SAAS solutions via browser

OS level is a plus, the ability to generate and run logic can only enhance the overall agentic capability

LLM, strict data isolation, hybrid is no critical



# Prompt Summary
# Research Statement: Agentic Deep Research Platforms for FedRAMP Environments

## Objective
Research and evaluate available "deep research" agentic platforms that can semantically search internal FedRAMP-compliant data as well as public/private API and browser-accessible data to form comprehensive understanding and solve business problems.

## Core Requirements
1. Deep research capabilities spanning both internal and external data sources
2. Must be hostable in a private cloud (FedRAMP) environment
3. No data retention or utilization for future model training by the vendor
4. Semantic search functionality with ability to generate embeddings for internal data
5. Agentic capabilities to interact with command line, bash prompts, browsers, and operating systems
6. Commercial off-the-shelf solutions preferred, but open-source solutions will be considered

## Technical Specifications
- **Data Sources Integration**: Platform should support API-accessible data sources with semantic search capabilities
- **Tool Interaction**: Agents should utilize tools in a human-like fashion, including interacting with SaaS solutions via browser
- **Operating System Access**: OS-level interaction capabilities are desired to enhance overall agentic functionality
- **AI Approach**: Large Language Models with strict data isolation; hybrid approaches are not critical
- **Security Context**: All security considerations should be well-understood, though specific security standards evaluation is not within current scope

## Additional Considerations
- **Compliance**: While not the primary focus, FedRAMP compliance is an essential requirement
- **Data Independence**: Must avoid any models which can share or train on organizational data
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Looking for fully agentic approach that can generate and run logic to enhance research capabilities
