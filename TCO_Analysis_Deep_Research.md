We are evaluating Microsoft 365 Co-Pilot.  We need to research the following questions:

1. Costs associated with building a custom solution, including salaries for developers, data scientists, project managers, and other relevant personnel.
2. Costs to buy a third-party solution, including licensing fees and any upfront payments.
3. Costs for integrating the new solution with existing systems and infrastructure.
4. Ongoing costs for maintaining the solution, including bug fixes, updates, and upgrades.
5. Costs for providing technical support to users, including help desk and training resources.
6. Costs for hardware and software infrastructure, including cloud services, servers, and storage.
7. Costs associated with training staff to use, maintain the solution, and change management for the solution.
8. Salaries and benefits for employees who will be managing, operating, and supporting the solution.
9. Ongoing costs of third-party solution subscriptions or licenses.
10. Costs for vendor-provided consulting services for implementation and optimization.
11. Costs to ensure the solution complies with relevant regulations and standards (e.g., FedRAMP, NIST, 'in boundary', CUI ATO)
12. Costs for implementing and maintaining security measures to protect data and systems.
13. Costs associated with scaling the solution to accommodate growth in users or data volume.
14. Costs for ensuring the solution can adapt to future needs and technological advancements.
15. The cost of lost opportunities due to the time it takes to build or implement the solution.
16. The potential loss or gain in competitive advantage depending on the chosen solution.
17. Costs related to project risks such as delays, budget overruns, or failure to meet requirements.
18. Costs associated with the risk of technology becoming obsolete or not performing as expected.

"Costs" should be interpreted as a question "What cost implications should we consider", we are not asking for monetary costs, we are looking for an understanding of "effort".  Based on the resulting research we will assign a "t-shirt size" to each question (xs, s, m, l, xl).

Q: Is this evaluation specifically within the context of a government or federal agency (given references to FedRAMP, CUI, etc.)?
A: GCC High.

Q: Are you comparing Microsoft 365 Co-Pilot to any other specific custom or third-party solution, or is the comparison general?
A: We are focused only on Microsoft 365 Co-Pilot for this research.

Q: Do you have a specific industry or domain context (e.g., finance, healthcare, public sector) that the solution needs to align with?
A: Public sector.

Q: Should we focus on research from U.S.-based deployments, or include global perspectives as well?
A: US Based.
